0,Fascinating impressive check in station for all the youth and the indoor man made garden is kind of memories for Singapore. Keep it up Singaporeans 💪
1,"I’m Singaporean and I don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of any mall in Singapore, until Jewel came about. It’s one mall I will make a trip to over and over again, because it has all that I need. 
1. Kids friendly cinema. Not many of my friends know this but Shaw has this cinema here that specially catered to parents with kids. They have a play area in front of the seats and the cinema is also dimly lit but bright enough for parents to watch over their little ones when they play at the play area. People are generally more understanding of noisy kids.
2. My favourite shopping outlets are all in this place - Zara, oysho, mango, cath kidston, seed by heritage for kids.
3. The food options are great and I always frequent one of these - violet Oon, beauty in the pot, burgers and lobsters, and snack time at birds of paradise, old Chang kee, Toast Box and leClaire by sarah Michelle.
4. Without a doubt, the BEST nursing room ever has got to be in Jewel. I was blown away by how comfortable the nursing rooms are."
2,"Singapore is hot and humid. The most of time we spent there was indoor. And Jewel was the best place we found, with beautiful waterfall and lots of shops and restaurants."
3,"Passed by many times and the rain of the sight of the rain vortex had never failed to arrest me. A few moment to admire the scene (definitely) then quick snaps of photos (if short of time) or a rest in the ""forest"" to watch the water flowing down. The place was always crowded with local and tourist alike but I could feel myself relax down. Kid really enjoyed it. An oasis right amidst the hustle bustle. If you transit or arrive in Singapore, recommend to come and admire this architect marvel."
4,"A brilliant design and architecture.
a jewel in an airport indeed.
a great place to spend time in waiting your flight."
5,"We flew from Changi to Sydney and were eager to visit the recently opened Jewel.

We checked in for our flight then followed the signs, which are clearly displayed, to this amazing feature.

It was very crowded, and we didn’t want to miss our flight so we weren’t able to spend as long as we would have liked, but it certainly takes your breath away. The lifts were very slow and jam packed so that made it harder to see everything. I gave up and walked down instead.

This wonderful attraction is linked to three of its passenger terminals, and was quite a walk for us from check in.

Built in a huge glass dome, the centrepiece is the astonishing Rain Vortex, the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. It’s surrounded by lush vegetation and terraces where you can sit and gaze at it in all its glory.

The site covers over 8 acres and has 12 storeys, 7 of which are at basement level.

The glass and steel facade was actually designed by the same architects who designed the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with its iconic ship perched on the top of the building.

The Shiseido Forest Valley is one of Asia’s largest indoor gardens. It covers around 22,000 square metres and spans 5 stories. It’s extraordinary to think that there are around 3,000 trees and 60,000 shrubs from all around the world.

But it’s piece de resistance has to be the astonishing Rain Vortex waterfall which dominates the centre of the garden, and stands 130 ft high. It cascades down from a round hole in the glass ceiling and an incredible 38,000 litres of recirculating rain water is pumped through the hole every minute. Below it is a huge basement level pool.

The glass roof, which is toroid shaped, is made up of over 9,000 pieces of glass. At night it becomes the  360 degree backdrop for a light and sound show, which sadly we could not stay for.

It’s a truly astonishing piece of engineering and design, and it is incredible to think that it is inside an airport.

We just didn’t have time to visit the canopy park, which is about $5 to enter, or the canopy mazes, but I was able to walk down to the bottom of the waterfall and stand and gaze in awe at its beauty.

It seems odd to want to spend more time in an airport, but there is still so much to see here in Jewel that I hope one day to return."
6,"I didn't believe that an airport could actually be a destination, but this one is.  If you are visiting Singapore, or have a layover, you MUST spend time in this airport.  Best if you can visit ""The Jewel"" at night, but beautiful any time. The entire airport is worth exploring."
7,"wide range of food selection, food is nice and lots of seat inside teh resturant, impressive design and you will not know is this an airport."
8,"It's no surprise that this has been voted the best airport in the world 7 times.  The indoor waterfall is spectacular - even better when the light shows are on.  There are lots of things to do, though you do have to pay for some of them.  There are plenty of eateries, but allow time if you are travelling at the weekend."
9,"Amazing place so much more than a shopping mall and the waterfall is amazing with or without the light show
A complete entertainment centre on the top level 
Plenty of venues for food and drink
Caters for all age groups"
10,This is really amazing never seen anything like this anywhere in the world. The view of the waterfall is breathtaking and very relaxing. You can go to different level and view the waterfall. You can get better view of waterfall on level 3. There are plenty seating areas to enjoy this waterfall. If you are in the airport this is a must visit.
11,"We chose to have a long layover in Singapore (15hrs) to be able to explore it for a day. This adventure started at the airport which we could have stayed in for the entire 15 hours without getting bored. They have many unique free things to do and see while you wait in the airport including a butterfly garden! This particular airport has been rated top in the world for the past 6 years and has definitely earned that title. The Jewel is the latest in their attractions and now holds the world record for the largest indoor waterfall. Hidden near the arrival hall of terminal 1 this is worth stopping by. This end of the airport includes a high end shopping mall with many international stores which hide the waterfall while adding more mystique to the attraction. There are many levels of stairs and walkways surrounding the jewel to allow you to get different perspectives of it and the iconic selfie by it. While we were there they had signs displayed that mentioned new additions to the Jewel experience this year which include a canopy bridge. This entire area of the airport will be adding over 10 new attractions estimated by the end of this year (2019). We highly advise stopping by even for a small layover to at least witness the airport for yourself. Keep in mind if you have a layover for over 5 hours the airport also offers free tour bus rides of Singapore as well!

12,"Been there multiple times and I haven't yet step into every single shop! I've been to different restaurants every time I went there and their service and food are good! Airport has always been a good hang out place and ever since Jewel's arrival, it just made things much better and enjoyable! 
For families with kids, I suggest you guys to visit the Canopy Park at the top floor! They will have tons of fun there!"
13,"Had a 10- hour layover and after sleeping at the hotel at the airport, we checked out the Jewel, which opened in October 2019. It's lush, peaceful, and air-conditioned, but you feel like you are outside. Definitely worth spending some time to see it - I viewed a documentary about it on a Singapore Airlines flight - it is immaculate and they do a great job of keeping it in tip-top shape."
14,This is one amazing place located at the airport. The vortex and indoor forest and almost too real.. Nice glass Walkway to see the vortex.
15,Beautiful with different stores (not all the same old brands!) and a fun set of attractions. We got the senior set 1 of 5 activities for S$27. Very clean!  They check your temperature and spray hand sanitizer on your hands at each section. Loved the mirror maze most!
16,"This is the latest addition to Changi Airport. It's huge with lots of shops and restaurants, as well as activities such as the Canopy Walk, maze etc. The trees and greenery really make it lovely. There are also flight check in counters here, where you can do an early check in, and then relax and wander around the place."
17,Amazing how quickly you actually can forget that you're on an airport waiting for a flight. In Terminal 1 in Changi Airport you enter Jewel and you instantly don't believe your eyes. There's this thrilling 40 meter high waterfall surrounded by beautiful tropical plants and trees. You can take a walk at different levels and/or visit the adjacent Canopy Park (small admission fee) with some nice attractions. So when you have a flight out of Singapore vond early and enjoy this awesome place. Luggage can be stored near the Jewel entrance and there also is an early check in.
18,"Jewel is one of the best things added to Changi airport in the last 10 years and has greatly raised the convenience of the aged Terminal One. Good mix of restaurants and retailers (especially liked Tokyu Hands, Muji, Bengawan Solo and the supermarket). Well done and keep it up please!"
19,"Simply the most incredible airport in the world , fabulous for restaurants, shopping, clean, quiet and sophisticated."
20,"At first bought the bundle ticket in order to do all activities and we thought that it was quite price : but it definitely worths every penny ! 

All activities were very funny and adapted for kids and big kids. 
Each part is very different from the others so it’s not boring and you can spend many hours there. The mall is also full of amazing shops and they are plenty of good restaurants , it’s such a good destination for a rainy Singaporean day."
21,That place is extraordinary.Im so amze with the vortex cant keep my eyes of it.Its very clean and very cool
22,I’d like to highly commend Carissa Santos from the Jewel Guest Centre who very kindly helped us find our car. Carissa noticed that I was repeating my steps when trying to locate our car in the car park and went out of her way to find me and assist me in finding my car. She was kind enough to spend a good 20 minutes helping us and even ensured we were safely in our car before saying goodbye. She went above and beyond what I expected - thank you Carissa!
23,"As a Singaporean, I'm proud to live in a country with the best airport in the world. You can spend the whole day at Jewel and you will still not feel that it is enough. Take your time and relax by the waterfall. The view of the waterfall, is best in any level you are at."
24,"I was an engineer for the project. Despite the fact that I have worked at the very same place on daily basis for almost 3 years, it never failed to amaze me every time I visit. Not sure about other, but it always reminds me of the Jurassic Park, of course, without the dinosaurs."
25,"We were amazed at the design of the place. 
So much thought has gone into the design. The shops are a shopaholics dream. There are many restaurants available including a Pizza Express where we enjoyed a lovely meal.
The most amazing part for us was the waterfall and the planting and the gardens. 
The best  bit was at 9.30pm when they have a light show on the fountain, just amazing. It has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  So glad we came to see it and would definitely recommend it."
26,We had a chance to fly through the Singapore Changi airport.  The Jewel at Terminal 1 is something that cannot be missed.  The waterfall is a sight to behold.  Take the escalators to the top floor and there are bars and restaurants overlooking the waterfall and gardens.  At each level in between are more restaurants and shopping.  You will think you are in a high-end mall and not an airport terminal.  The Jewel has to be seen to be believed!
27,"Jewel Changi Airport will definitely be an ideal location to carry out wedding proposal. Although it is a nerve-wrecking experience to carry out wedding proposal in a crowded place, there is no worry of rain or shine as it is an indoor environment. With just simple preparation, coupled with the setting - she worn the diamond on 20th May 2019 at 1314hr."
28,The airport itself is a tourist attraction. It's super modern and at the same time close to nature feels. Waiting for a long flight scheduled? Jewel got your back!
29,"We really enjoy our quality hours at Jewel shopping mall Changi airport, not only for shopping and eating, but also for exploring an amazing Neo- futurism architectural style. This iconic building is designed by the world- renowned architect Moshe Safdie, (a 81 years old, Israeli-born who is behind iconic Marina Bay Sands resort). It is opened in April 2019 to welcome 300,000 visitors per day, so far we heard that over 50 millions have visited it. The highlight of Jewel atrium is the largest indoor water fall - 40 meters high rain vertex and 5 storey-forest-valley with walking trails. This iconic spot is highly recommended especially at night time you will be able to marvel the colorful light show."
30,The Rain Vortex is absolutely mesmerising. Make sure to catch the show if you are visiting in the evening! Each show lasts about 5 mins and runs from 8.30pm to 12.30am daily at hourly intervals. Hands down the best experience you can get at an airport!
31,"We went to see JEWEL at Terminal 1 on our way out of Singapore. Must see when in
Singapore. Multilevel greenery in Terminal 1 with a tremendous waterfall, 40 meters tall, in the center, dropping from the ceiling and disappearing into the floor, on level 1. Your view of this amazing waterfall changes with the level you are viewing from. There is greenery throughout this immaculately clean airport."
32,"A great place to spend time in transit. Early checkin for several airlines saved the day, and allowed us to look around more freely."
33,"We spent a day here (including having lunch in the middle),  the waterfall was a beautiful sight. We bought a package to enter the canopy park and do all the attractions. Loved the Mirror maze, the mist bridge and the bouncy nets. The net walk was harder and scarier than we expected, little feet go through the net. See the waterfall from all the different levels using the elevator. Kids loved this place (aged 6 and 9)"
34,This is really amazing and worth the visit. Make sure you watch the light show in the evening at the indoor waterfall. It’s really relaxing just sitting and watching the waterfall here during anytime of the day. I have visited a few times when returning to Singapore at Terminal 1. Changi airport has always been amazing but the Jewel took it to a new level. Would definitely recommend it.
35,"We took the opportunity to visit Jewel. This is a very well done project. It is very comfortable to walk around and have your meals here. There are many restaurants and eateries, a food court and supermarket as well."
36,A truly wondrous experience. If ever there was a place that has the potential to reignite a sense of childish wonder in a world full of competing sensory experiences this is it. Set in Changi Airport “Jewel” is a destination in itself and one where you could quite easily spend a
37,"We came there only for the waterfall and the green sourroundings, but we observed that there were quite a few restaurants, cinema etc. in addition to the waterfall.Very nice waterfall, and a great building."
38,"Large shopping mall. Convenient for the travellers and locals. No more worries to find place to kill times while waiting for the flights. There are lounges, early check in, luggage service, food, shops and all the activities! "
39,"I have been to many world city airports, and Changi Airport is simply amazing, and one of the best airports that I have been too!  Changi Airport was designed in mind with entertaining people, and two areas that will be on my list next time is Kinetic Rain, and the five unique"
40,The Jewel at Changi Airport is a delightful step away from the traditional airport building. The combination of an amazing attraction with many retail and restaurant options in an airport location is alluring to both tourists as well as locals.
41,"Nestled at the heart of Changi Airport is this work of art that even Picasso can’t even believe. Name better way to welcome a tourist coming from overseas to Singapore. I bet you can’t. Jewel is indeed Singapore’s Jewel alongside with the famous Gardens by the Bay. Such an eyecandy. And to all the tourist travelling SG, please, do yourself a favor, before going to your homestay or hotel, walk an extra meter to see this work of art."
42,Nice place for shopping and in built magnificent waterfall is awesome to view and overall a nice experience
43,"The best place to waste time whilst waiting to catch your flight. Magnificent architecture and gardens around waterfall. Shopping, food courts etc- entertainment- it’s a great way to kill a few hours."
44,"Wow what can I say.... This gem will knock sports of most attractions and certainly any global airport. 

If you are not flying from T1 and can get to the airport a little earlier then get yourself over to “The Jewel” around 10min walk from T3. I promise you this you will not be disappointed. 

A must see ❤️"
45,"Situated opposite T1 we checked our luggage in early here downstairs and left luggage here too. The centre has an amazing indoor waterfall/feature set amongst what I would describe as a tropical rain forest, similar to the design of the Cloud Forest dome. Inside are loads of"
46,Beautifully designed. An instagram magnet. Has all the best restaurants in Asia here. We has the best dim sums. Highly recommended. Can be busy around the atrium fountain btw.
47,It's number 1 ranked in the world for a reason. Every terminal shop and gate feels like luxury. Amazing waterfall! Long walk from some terminals but worth it.
48,"Although we flew into Changi Airport, we were leaving from a different city - thus needed to take public transportation back into the airport so we could experience Jewel, the Operculum that takes your breath away.  It is so refreshing to experience; you really do need to"
49,"i end up at Jewel Changi Airport after i'm finish up my assignn't at other place in singapore....suprisingly, Jewel really easy to found from mrt station at terminal 3 coz of large and clear signboard...after a long walk( about 15 min ), finally indoor waterfall caught my eyes"
50,"First things first, we walked a lot, I mean a lot. So be prepared if you want to go to see the amazing waterfall. It was a good experience as we had some no of hours for our flight. We did not go anywhere else to be honest, just roamed around the waterfall, with all the greenery."
51,"Top mall that showcases our futuristic vortex waterfall with light shows every evening. Fab mix of retail brands ranging from casual to high-end and a wide variety of restaurant types and cuisines. Child-friendly, the top floor features an indoor park for children and adults to climb, stroll, and chill. B2 has a child-friendly cinema at Shaw theatres that has a play area for the kids while the adults watch the show. So huge that you can get a bit lost, but there are handy touchscreen info electronic boards at almost every escalator. Favourite new mall in the east!"
52,"My husband and I were in Singapore’s Changi Airport last December for our flight home.   Jewel is Singapore’s newest attraction - a large nature-themed retail complex located adjacent to the airport.  There are many restaurants inside – both high-end and Hawker style dining in the basement.   It’s free to enter (no luggage carts), but the attractions have fees.   If you have luggage and bags, there are several baggage storage shops available before you enter.

The star of this place is their indoor waterfall.  It’s the world’s tallest at 40 meters (131 ft).  Since it was very crowded around the waterfall, we walked around until we found a quiet place to sit and admire this beautiful rain vortex surrounded by lush plants and trees. 

But my favorite feature of Jewel is their restrooms!  Some toilets have Japanese style bidets that squirt water from underneath the seat.  It was pretty AWESOME!  I think ALL the public restrooms in the world should have this feature!  

Jewel is a perfect place to be if you have a lot of time to spare in the Singapore airport.  It is a destination in itself!"
53,"Anyone arriving into Singapore must not miss to visit The Jewel Side in the terminal.One of the most relaxing environment with water features lots of Greenery ,sound effects and also many restaurants to eat from.You can also visit it during your transit to else where . Singapore Changi consists of 4 terminals but all inter connected.Either you take a stroll or use the terminal trains.
Enjoy your time there."
54,"Destination itself. Well worth spending time. You can check bags in early here, print boarding passes and enjoy! Great shopping to browse and fantastic choice of eating!!! 
The waterfall is amazing and area great place to chill and relax."
55,"Jewel is the latest attraction in Changi Airport. It comprises of fashion shops, eateries and exclusive attractions such as mirror maze, canopy park, hedge maze etc. The main attraction of Jewel is the rain vortex! It is gorgeous!"
56,"Basically this is a entry free version of the flower dome from Gardens by the bay. 
If you are flying out, make sure you do not go through customs. The Jewel is a public access mall. Problem is with the your bags. As trolleys are not allowed in the elevator(what are they thinking when they design this place). As a trade off, there is a baggage storage at ground level. 
Best light show happens after dark."
57,"if you are in Singapore and missed jewel changi  then your trip is useless.
jewel has so much to offer you for whole day.
actually its a part of airport it self but you can't visit if you don't have visa for Singapore bcz you have to pass through immigration then you may go there by free airport bus.
i planned my visit on first day only after i landed in Singapore. bcz my flight arrival was at morning 10.30 so i planned my first day till evening 7.00 there only.  around 7pm there is free sound and light show at HSBC rain vortex   don't miss it.

basement to floor 5th  so much to see, shopping, etc. and on 5th floor there are few activities you must try. buy its combo tickets from its website only. don't buy separate attractions on website.

for me bouncing net and mirror maze  was very exciting.  you may jump as much you can on bouncing net. forget your age and just chill."
58,"We had a 2am flight so arrived with plenty of time to explore the Jewel.  Wasn’t aware everything closes early.  The light show on the waterfall was still on and amazing.  Wheelchair friendly mostly everywhere.  Sorry we missed it during open hours.  Found it difficult to find somewhere to eat. Was a weekend so perhaps could look at later closing hours.  Accessibility amenities available. And  lifts, just spread out."
59,"Don't visit Singapore , or transit via Changi Airport without visiting 'The Jewel' ! The name is well deserved : Impressive construction , beautiful indoor waterfall surrounded by an indoor tropical garden , great shopping and restaurants within the structure..."
60,If you have about 20 minutes to spare then head down to the magnificent Jewel terminal which has a stunning waterfall and a lot of indoor greenery. We walked to it from inside the departure terminal before checking in for our flight.
61,"We did not have time to spend in the airport before or after our flight and I could not leave Singapore without seeing the Jewel. So, we took a subway and spent all day at the airport. Words cannot describe how beautiful this place is. Bright and airy, clean, tons of space to sit and enjoy and, the rain vortex left me speechless. Do not miss the Canopy Park. I recommended going early in the morning before the airport rush. It will be well worth it. You don't need a boarding pass to enter Jewel. It's directly connected to MRT station and signs to guide you there are clearly posted."
62,"Well got here about five hours early for our flight ; but didn’t bother me as I was under the impression there was lots to do at the airport . There isn’t ; there are plenty of places to grab something to eat and some duty free and other shops , but I think they were all rather expensive . Went to butterfly garden and it was smaller than I thought it would be and I didn’t see one butterfly ; might of had something to do with the fact that it was nighttime ; but if that’s the case they should put a sign up to let people know ; do butterflies sleep at night ,I don’t know and obviously neither did all the other people that were in there expecting to see butterflies"
63,"We recently had an opportunity to visit Singapore for the Asian Airshow. While there we got to visit the Jewel and it is amazing, incredible and a must see. It alone makes Changi the most incredible airport. We also happened to eat at a restaurant in the Jewel. However, while the meal was great, we could not keep our eyes off the waterfall. In addition to rain pouring in, the waterfall also periodically becomes a mister bellowing out a cloud from the oculus in the ceiling. However the one is simply one part. The overall round glass structure is just as amazing and complete with its own areal playground. Not to mention see the monorail pass directly though it. Great feature and amazing attraction."
64,"Singapore's Changi airport has been rated number one in the world for several years - with good reason.  The latest attraction, the Jewel, is a simply amazing creation of imagination.  The center, a giant indoor waterfall is a great focal point.  If you can, catch the night time light show.

Tips:  (1) If you have a long layover, you'll have to exit security to access the Jewel.  It's worth it.  (2) If you wanted to explore it before you fly out, most airlines have early check in services at the Jewel.  Check with your airline.  (3) Give yourself plenty of time to explore.  This is a huge complex.  Enjoy."
65,"Just a spectacular place. So gorgeous to look at and explore. Lots of food, shopping and entertainment options. It's like a city centre! I absolutely loved it. Give it a day of your vacation."
66,"If you've an hour to spare whilst in transit at Changi airport, or you want to check-in more than three hours before your flight (which you can do at The Jewel), make sure you give it a visit. The huge multi-coloured waterfall, the indoor forest, the shopping and eating, the"
67,"The Jewel is a shopping centre located opposite Terminal 1 and this is something you do when you arrive at the airport or at least 2 hours before you check in for departure. As soon as you enter, you will see this waterfall which is simply impressive. It has a few floors I think"
68,"The Jewel truly amazing..must visit! Great way to spend few hours during transit in singapore. Must clear singapore immigration, walking distance from airport terminal"
69,"Jewel has as its centrepiece a stunning waterfall, come tube of water, it is symmetrical and stunning. there is a rainforest canopy of trees and plants growing all around, with a train line running through.if you have time catch the sky train through it, if you have more time,"
70,This is an absolutely must see when you are in Singapore. Entrance is free but there are some charge options. We spent about 3 hours there and had a wonderful time
71,"Staying in Crowne Plaza so exploring here was essential. It was slightly subdued because of the reduction in travellers.
But the centre piece indoor waterfall is outstanding. Only in Singapore would you find such imaginative architecture. Watching the falls change colour as two trains perfectly synchronised passed each other behind them was awe inspiring"
72,"Who would ever says they are impressed with airports? They basically serve a purpose. Some are good and some are not but Singapore Airport is a whole new level. The airport has to be one of the most organised and cleanest places we've travelled to. We stayed for one night at Crowne Plaza.

The Jewel is land-side between terminals 2 and 3 and is very aptly named. It tends to be restaurants, coffee lounges and so on. There are several bars on the top level. There are some tourist attractions to visit and if you are passing through Singapore, I'd suggest you take time out to include this place.  I would not say that about any other airport we've been through! Many airlines have a bag drop so you can get rid of your suitcase early and relax before you go air-side through security for your flight. Even air-side there is plenty to do and see.

The world's biggest waterfall is impressive and in the evening from 7.30pm they do light shows with music."
73,"Singapore is known for so many Malls! And this one is really amazing and worth the visit. Make sure you watch the light show in the evening at the tallest indoor waterfall. 
It’s relaxing and peaceful just sitting and watching the waterfall here during anytime of the day. I have visited many times and will be keep going time to time😀"
74,"We had a wait for conecting flight at the airport so jumped onto the conecting train and headed over to the Jewel. Fantastic experiance one I'm happy to have taken. The airport is amazing but the Jewel took it to a new level. Floor 5 is outstanding great restaurants, the water fall, the flower walk, just awesome. The shops were great but for me the whole place has to be an experiance not to be missed."
75,Took leave to enjoy our day but was not allowed into the skynets bouncing and walking with my 5 year old kid. He was just 2 cm short of 110 cm requirement. So had to leave without doing anything there. Asked for a cash refund but the management refused. So we had paid 80 for a whole family outing without doing anything. Waited for a long while for the queue as well. We booked a scheduled timing for the skynets and my boy left the scene crying
76,I visited the Jewel as I was early for my flight - it is well worth a visit! I payed to enter the gardens and to visit the Canopy Bridge - its crazy this is in an airport!
77,This place so beautiful that we are speechless about it. This place is marvelous an indoor waterfall and forest. This place located at terminal-1 of Changi airport. I strongly recommend all tourists to visit this place.
78,"We were there because we had some spare days in SGP. It will take an hour to reach here from anywhere in the city. There is not much to do in form of activities. You can take a stroll or stay near the rain vortex. The paid attractions are quite unimaginative. Its better to just stroll for a while, eat/drink something and just take a bus ride back."
79,"Singapore is truly a unique place, and this airport is no exception. It has the largest indoor waterfall, and it’s very fun to get views of it from the four or five different levels, all the way at the base, to almost at the very top. It’s very beautiful to walk around and take in the interesting scenery. There are tons of shops and places to eat in a very condensed place. We checked in early so we could have some time to wander around."
80,Jewel is a must-visit! The shopping mall is big and very well-designed. The indoor waterfall is really wonderful.
81,This is a large part of the airport which is big enough in itself and gives it a really modern feel to it with an architecture of its own
82,"The best airport in the world. It is like jurassic park. A combination between technology and nature, which is the basis of Singapore. The one time you want to get to the airport early and see the whole thing."
83,"The selection of food brands and shops in Jewel is really fantastic. There's some brand you can't get in other parts of Singapore - like A&E and Shake Shack. In fact, the queues for those places are ridiculously and surprisingly long!

The fountain is a must see and adds a nice touch to the ambience. There's timings for the music and light show - worth catching if you're only passing through once. And there's many good vantage points to see it from as the mall is circular around the fountain, with many floors to view it from."
84,"The waterfall and indoor garden is amazingly beautiful. This will blow your mind if you think Changi airport is nice. There are also huge selection of restaurants, some with looong queues like shakeshack and a&w. Please go visit when you are in airport!"
85,"I used the Singapore Airport at the end of my cruise from Dubai to Singapore.  Since I had several hours to kill I decided to go and see the new Jewel.  The information desk suggested that I check my luggage first and then go and see the Jewel.  It is about 10 minutes from terminal 3 where my plane was leaving.  I noticed that there were several warnings for people to make sure that they did have enough time to go see the Jewel.  I can imagine that you could lose track of time while visiting this area.

The Jewel is spectacular and there are shops and places to eat in the same area.  I would highly recommend going to see this site as it is free and very impressive."
86,We thought we would visit the Jewel whilst we were waiting for our flight so we asked at the information desk how to get to it. The lady was very helpful but told us we would really need five hours to visit because you need to go back through immigration and need plenty of time to walk around it. Unfortunately we did not have the time but she recomended taking the Skytrain between terminals 2 and 3 which passes right through the Jewel and slows down as you pass through. We made a trip there and back on the Skytrain so was able to marvel at the plantings and that spectacular waterfall. Would factor in extra time to your travel arrangements if you can. It's pretty awesome.
87,"This is seriously the most amazing experience - one can spend the whole day here and not be bored. Food is amazing, the waterfall is spectacular and the walk is spell binding. The shops are pretty cool as well. Everything is well designed and beats the experience in T3 or T2. In fact spend as much time here and have your meals here too as the food in T3 or T2 is not great compared to Jewel. The overbridge to T3 takes about 10 minutes and you can do early check in here for Singapore Airlines and a few others. 

This takes airports to another level altogether.. I have been to airports in KLIA, Heathrow, Incheon, HK, Taiwan and Jewel beats all of them. Absolutely love!"
88,"Is the best shopping area in an airport (and I passed 40+), impressive architecture, main brand stores like in Downtown, great food option (fine dining or average price like Tonito, with amazing view). No sense to pay for activities, as you can walk everywhere, and the Flying fox or amusement area are small and expansive. As well as the Baggage depot: NO SENSE TO USE IT IF your Airline have EARLY CHECK-IN in Changi (in Jewel L1)  4-6-9-12 hours before! Just stroll around for 1-2-3H, leave the baggage to your airline directly, and enjoy 6-9 hours of Singapore downtown!"
89,The Jewel Changi Airport is an impressive Shopping mall with a lot of (high priced) Shops. The absolute Highlight is the waterfall.
90,"I like this airport so much, I have been 4 times there. Not only the biggest fountain is great but all the shops also so nice."
91,Another visually captivating attraction... but one that you can catch at Changi after you've just collected your boarding pass (if you're departing) or your bags (if you're arriving) and within easy reach from your terminal by airbridge. We did the Canopy Walk (S$5- p/p) and
92,This additional shows why Singapore has the best airport in the world. A building dedicated to shopping and great food within walking distance from all terminals? Wow. Definitely worth a visit if you have time
93,"Amazing - we loved exploring the canopy and the mirror maze. We had dinner downstairs in the food court which was clean, delicious and reasonably priced. We were also able to arrange point of pick up for grab car without having to venture back to the terminal.   Unfortunately we"
94,"Since we had a late flight out, decided to check out at noon and spend our afternoon and early evening at Jewel Changi. We were not disappointed. Not only is the architecture of the central dome stunning, the whole concept of indoor nature with waterfall and other features has"
95,"It is a must see. I would recommend to reach Airport way before departure so as to explore the Airport. The Airport is really huge comprising of The Jewel, Shopping Malls, Food courts. 

It is like another tourist attraction in Singapore & allocating a couple of hours here is worth it."
96,"We had seen the jewel online before visiting Singapore , but made it our first go to destination  when we arrived . 
We had landed in Singapore early and could not check into our Hotel until 3pm ,so we just got onto the next MRT back to Changi Airport and  spent some time shopping in the huge shopping mall,  tried a couple of places to eat and then headed for the Jewel which was awesome, granted it was daytime but still worth it . We did make time later in our stay to visit in the evening for the light show, it is worth it even if  it only lasts around ten minutes  it is repeated on the hour so you do have the opportunity to catch a great light show. Tip do not try to visit if you have gone through immigration . the only way you will be able to see it is seated on the monorail that goes passed on the journey between terminals. Just take the time to visit during your stay in Singapore it is well worth it."
97,"This airport is not your typical one. Besides a full shopping mall and food court the gardens, waterfall and vortex are something to see. You can spend hours in the airport."
98,"This man made structure is amazing. Located by the Airport and mall, it strategically showcases and introduces the waterfall admist shopping and eating outlets. Very popular with locals and tourists."
99,"We had 6 hours to spend between disembarking our cruise and boarding our long flight home.  After a long, exciting but challenging day exploring Singapore, we needed to relax before departure.  The Jewel provided the perfect venue to accomplish this.  We were easily able to check in our bags early for our flight, store our carryons for a minimal fee and then explore the Jewel.  And what a jewel it is!  This is the first airport installation that meets the needs of a wide range of travellers of all ages.   We bought entry into the Canopy Park where we enjoyed walking through the hedge maze and topiary walk, watching children run off energy at the Discovery slides and Foggy Bowls.  We wandered through the park enjoying the 5 story rain vortex, the world’s highest waterfall, from all angles.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Changi Experience Studio while I checked out a few shops and relaxed.  There are countless shops and restaurants to visit as well as an imax with laser technology., banks, and a supermarket.  There is something for everyone here within easy access to the terminals.  Innovative and beautiful."
100,"Changi Airport is one of the best airports in the World. From shopping to eating, sightseeing to watching movies, play areas to the swimming pool with jacuzzi, one can find everything at this airport.  But the best thing and my favorite thing to do is spending time in the Jewel"
101,Wonderful experience by seeing different perspective of jewel airport and a good place to shop and chill 
102,"It's a must visit to see this latest attraction at Singapore airport, know as THE JEWEL, which is the largest indoor waterfall.   This is located between terminal 2 and 3 and is a must visit. It is also connected with terminal 1 and even if you have luggage there is no issue"
103,If you have to spend time in an airport Singapore is the airport of choice. All terminals have something to see but the Jewel in Terminal 1 is the place to go. An amazing waterfall and more shopping than anyone needs. Bear in mind that certain airlines allow very very early
104,We visited Jewel with our friend on a Sunday. It is an amazing space with a rain vortex that gushes down the core of the building over 7 storeys in height. It has lots of space to relax and chill out which iis not always easy to find in Singapore. The overall area is free and
105,"Hanging here is a treat! Come early just to experience the full effects of the 10 story waterfall and infinity pool. Stand on any floor and you’re immersed into the forest of trees and plants. 

This airport duals as a giant shopping mall, amusement park, and dining hall. With 100 places to find something to eat or drink you won’t go hungry. 

The Jewel is aptly named as it’s truly the jewel of all airports!"
106,The Airport Jewel water feature is a must see as it’s a great photo op and time waster for transfers and general waiting around. The shops are great but no access when you leave unfortunately.
107,"My husband & myself loved peranakan food.  We were at the Jewel,  Violet Oon’s restaurant for dinner last night .  We ordered the mango salad, Ngoh Hiang, udang bakar with sambal & Ayam buah keluah. All the dishes was delicious except for the Ayam buah keluah.  It was so sour.  When the dish arrived it looks so good that both of us scoop a big spoon full of  the gravy onto our rice and mixed it.  Thereafter,our plate of rice became extremely sour & spicy that every spoon full of it into our mouth was so difficult to swallow.  In order not to waste food we tried very hard to finish the ayam(chicken). It was not the original peranakan taste.  
Sad and sorry to say that the dish was horrible.  Feedback to the waiter ,  was told that Asam and chilies were added.  The dish was eventually waive  off on our bill.  We left the restaurant with a sour face.😭😭😭"
108,"Never in my dreams would I expect to see a waterfall in an airport - but there it is.

We were early for our flight and we'd read about the Jewel opening in 2019 so decided to go and eat plus sightsee.

The planted forest and waterfall area is truly breathtaking.  We were lucky as there were fewer visitors due to virus fears as I can imagine it gets very crowded in the centre.
The rest of the mall is 10 floors of shopping and eating.  You can also check in and store bags if you want to walk around unencumbered"
109,"Still one of the best airports in the World (that I have visited)
Great customer service and services.  An interesting place to spend the time between flights. There was some great food choices, but I decided on some nourishing noodles. I had no room in my carry on so I wasn't tempted to buy anything. 
A food massage was just what the doctor ordered. 
I wish I had known that there was a pool. Will check it out next time."
110,"you can have a walk around and check out the waterfall area. it is beautiful and with all the floral, is like you walk into a forest.
It has a lot of cafes and restaurant.
Best of all, it has Pokemon Center!!!"
111,"The centrepiece of the Jewel is the waterfall that falls from the ceiling of the dome. Officially known as the Rain Vortex, at 40 metres high it’s the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. You can see this from all the angles and beautifully lit at night when the colour changes"
112,Best airport in the world with best amenities. The waterfall is amazing and also the flower garden and canopy bridge. Well connected from the main airport.
113,It is a new shopping in Changi airport. Obviously the most attractive object in this mall is the artificial waterfall which is right in the middle of the mall. I liked the design which give a sense of the forest feel. There is no observation deck but you view it from different floors. The mall offered variety of branded goods. It is an expensive place for shopping at least I enjoyed the windows shopping the free air-cond as the climate in Singapore was really hot during the time I visited.
114,When we landed at Changi Airport they were screening for corona virus and asked a lot of questions.  We were good to enter Singapore from Canada. This airport is so beautiful out of a story book.  The Jewel is outstanding and we enjoyed it very very much.
115,"This the best airport for travel, shopping and facilities with very friendly staff.
Very easy access to city center"
116,"Absolutely stunning venue and can spend all day there, the waterfall alone is spectacular. Singapore Changi airport is a destination on its own, now with Jewel it’s the best ever."
117,"Jewel takes the concept of shopping centres to a whole new level.

Outstanding architecture, a huge variety of shops, discounts for tourists, and plenty of attractions on the top two floors to keep you entertained. The rain vortex is the obvious centre attraction but that’s only the start of what Jewel has to offer.

To fully enjoy Jewel, I recommend allocating at least 3 hours of your time to it.

Highly recommended."
118,The waterfall is absolutely stunning and is surrounded by various shops and restaurants. Perfect place to wait for a flight. Best airport in the world.
119,"We had some time to kill before our late flight.  Saw a movie in the basement.  Got food from the ""hawker stalls"".  But, the waterfall (at least) was shutdown for 8 days for yearly maintenance; so missed the part I wanted to see.  Not sure if the hikes were open."
120,"This, I have to say is an architectural marvel! As I was standing in the middle of this structure and watching the monorail go through it, I felt like I was in Disney World! You can watch videos or look at photos but it’s nothing like being there in person looking at the power of the water and beautiful foliage.  Surrounding it on multiple levels is a shopping mall with a variety of name-brand stores that everyone will recognize. There’s also an abundance of quality food options. If you love coffee and the café culture, you’ll feel overwhelmed by the amount of choices. You’re also feel overwhelmed by the amount of dessert shops I stayed away from. Follow the signs from any terminal do. All the walking is indoors to/from The Jewel."
121,"We arrived at Jewel about two hours before our flight departure time, so we were able to enjoy the main attraction, the waterfall, and the surrounding rainforest before we had to leave. It was enough time to help us relax. We did not get a chance to explore other features of Jewel."
122,"Singapore airport was stunning and without a doubt the best experience I’ve ever had in an airport.
The jewel was worth visiting without flying!"
123,"the Terminl 4 (Jewel) in the Changi Airport is the most interestingterminal I´ve seen around the world. Beside many shops and restaurants there is a dome with a waterfall in the middle. After sundown every 30 minutes starts a show with lights and sound and any traveler is at rsik to miss the flight, just by watching the event. 
When travellung to Sungapore or just at transit, you must take the time to go to terminal 4. There is a skytrain an a bridge and it is easy to get there from any terminal."
124,"The Jewel is within the Airport Complexes, a short distance from the Arrival at Terminal 1. It has a Mall with an impressive waterfall coming from the glass ceiling of a dome. It is surrounded by greenery. I has a high humidity. There are railway tracks for small trains to travel within the dome. As with all Malls, there are restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. It is worth a visit as there are no other in the world (as far as I know).

I was there very early when I landed at 9.00am in Singapore. It is a popular place and gets crowded. Enjoy!"
125,This place is huge shopping and shopping its just great. All marjor airport should have this . It's just way. To get a taste of what Singapore has to offer
126,"Awesome, beautiful, remarkable ! 
Changi Jewel is wonderfully transformed into an inviting place for both tourists and Singaporeans to enjoy. Lights, sounds, music.food eateries, cinema, shopping paradise"
127,"We visited the Jewel at Changi Airport on the 6th January. The place is huge with a massive shopping centre hidden within the complex. The highlight of the Jewel is the free standing waterfall in the centre of the facility.
Unfortunately there was maintenance taking place during our visit (so the water had been turned off) 
During our visit to the shops within the the Jewel we noticed it had started to rain! 
As we walked past the waterfall started falling in all its glory! What a wonderful sight"
128,"Jewel at Singapore Changi Airport is simply an overachiever. They just beat themselves in term of architectural & engineering feat. You feel like you are back to the future.  Surreal feeling when you move towards the centre fountain & slowly the sound of water gush your ears, then you are presented with the greatest of view. Every area you go you just cant take your eyes off of the big fountain. Enormous landscape, plenty of interesting shops & restaurant. Only downside is the building is cramp with people during long holiday."
129,"We arrived at Terminal 1 of Changi airport and the exit led directly to the indoor man made waterfall of Jewel.   The water fall was huge and majestic.  Pretty impressive.  

The surrounding landscape and greenery was very pleasant too.  

Great place to go upon arrival after a flight."
130,"Staff of jewel, by the name of Rafly Mohamad, rudely chase us away when we tried to grab a meal in Jewel upon arrival. This place requires more training of their staff before allowing them to be on duty. We gave up our meal in Jewel"
131,"Got to the Singapore airport four hours before departure just so I could visit Jewel. It was well worth the the time. The Rain Vortex of course was the central draw, but there was plenty of stores and restaurants to explore."
132,"We arrived in Singapore in the evening and just needed to get out of the airport, so we had to return to the airport the next day just to visit the Jewel. By taxi, it cost about $20 from downtown to the Jewel.  The rain vortex is definitely the highlight of the Jewel and with"
133,"I had a 12 hour stopover in Singapore and wanted to fill in time until 1am. I planned the day to make the most of my time in Singapore. I have been many times, but never bothered to visit the “Jewel Changi Airport”. On the recommendation of a Singaporean friend, I decided to"
134,"I visited Jewel on my way home from Singapore and got to the airport especially to check out Jewel.  There’s a lot to see here - apart from the Rain Vortex, there are activities available on level 5 / the top floor which unfortunately you have to pay for (I didn’t this time),"
135,I wanted to the Topiary Walk & Hedge Maze but didn't have time. Had lunch at Arteastiq and browsed around the shops after taking photos of the beautiful waterfall. A must-see in Singapore. Go earlier to avoid crowds.
136,"Another magnificent and artistic engineering done by Singapore, it's a waterfall flowing from the ceiling to the bottom center of the building. Just by seeing it amazed me. In order not to mess my flight schedule, I dedicate one day just to visit the Jewel."
137,"I enjoy myself when I was at Jewel Changi Airport with my mum.  We have lots of fun shopping, roaming about, in search of the waterfall, eating at Basement 2 and Level 2.  You will find that you don't want to leave the place. It is very busy spot. Come and join us."
138,Visited from mid-morning to early afternoon.  One of the things I wanted to visit on my trip to Singapore was the recently opened Jewel at Changi Airport. It did not disappoint - the world’s largest indoor waterfall is truly awe-inspiring.  There are number of additional paid
139,"You could spend a few days exploring the airport. Now that The Jewel has been added you can just about make your stop at Changi a destination by itself.  It’s a HUGE shopping center with an endless supply of activities, eateries, shopping and sights to see and experience.   We"
140,"We’re traveling with our two teenage grandsons 13n 15
What an amazing place to visit young n old  
Our visit was made even better by meeting a young man named Christian who was extremely friendly and helpful and took the time to take some pics for us on the sky bridge and generally talked to us with staff like this the Jewel Canopy experience can only be wonderful for more n more travellers"
141,"Truly magnificent, you cannot miss this. The architect and his team to have this vision are nothing short of amazing. Apart from the flagship stores such as Apple, you can dine/drink to your hearts content in a multitude of restaurants in this complex. Then you walk into the Forest Valley and are stunned by the 40 metre Rain Vortex where you should sit and take it all in. Buy tickets to the Canopy Park and Canopy Bridge. Walk quietly through the gardens and maze, be in awe and wonder how did they plant those trees (especially the two 100+ year old Olive Trees). There are activities in the park for children such as playing in the Foggy Bowls, bounce on the Skynets, go down the slide - enjoy!!! Walk over the glass bottomed bridge and look down. Hopefully take in the light show through the Vortex, magical.
This is a world class attraction in what is, to my mind, the best airport in the world.
However, before I finish, could I suggest more Taxi signage be installed."
142,"Went to the airport with my wife recently and found it really convenient going into Jewel to the early check-in section and checking in our bags so we could walk around the attraction.
Wow, it was breathtaking. It was basically a mini rainforest within a giant dome with the world’s largest indoor waterfall in the centre!
Great place with a glass bridge, play areas for kids, rope walkways etc. My wife enjoyed the shopping and I enjoyed the variety of food outlets. If only every airport had one of these waiting for flights would no longer be a chore 😜😀"
143,"A jewel in the real meaning of the word! Located at the heart of Singapore Changi airport, it's a wondrous world. World's tallest indoor waterfall of 40 M, it is a sight to behold. Had 30 minutes before we had to catch our flight we experienced this amazing, stunning, mesmerizing attraction. Full of spectators looking up & around snapping away with their cameras it is an awe filled world. Their are also shops and restaurants but people come here mostly for the waterfall."
144,"I spent 5 hours here while waited for my friend. In fact, I didn’t get bored!! There are a lot of attractions. A beautiful fall, some cafes, shopping areas and so on. That’s the greatest airport in the world. I strongly recommend. Once you are there, you'll know what to do:)"
145,If you are waiting for your flight don’t hesitate to come to jewel and explore the beauty of falls. The show was great.
146,"Simply quite staggering ! I can’t recommend this enough, in fact it should be the major portion of an exclusive Tour of Singapore for Tourists from Europe."
147,"Since we were at the Singapore airport early, we had time to see Jewel Changi Airport. It is a free attraction with futuristic giant waterfall from the top of the dome and indoor plants. They even had Michelin starred Japanese Ramen place there. If you have more than 2 hours transit and not a lot of time to go to downtown Singapore, this is the place to visit."
148,"The garden and waterfall are nice, but this is basically a mall full of global shopping. There are no nice restaurants or bars with good views. Instead, they are all brightly lit and cheaply furnished. If you're traveling with children, they may enjoy the canopy walk or maze, but for adults, the place is a bore.
Much ado about nothing."
149,"Very hot and humid but very cool to see cascading water like this. It's no Niagara Falls, but this made for a nice first impression to Singapore. It's just really really crowded. The mall it is inside of is real nice."
150,"Our flights didn't connect so we had 23 hours in Changi airport in Singapore.  Simply put, this is the best place if you have to lay over between flights.  Our hotel was in the complex and there are so many options for dining.  After a comfortable relaxing night we utilised the early airline checkin facilities and enjoyed some of the attractions on the top level for a few hours while we waited for our flight."
151,What a structure! The indoor fountain is breathtaking and the shops are numerous that satisfies every taste. A must see attraction. Three hours should suffice.
152,"Directly go to Jewel Changi after arrived in Terminal 4, this place was really huge and still feels good because it's indoor and the AC is cooling properly. Too bad that the 2nd level of waterfall which is I just known called rain vortex is under maintenance, but the 1st level is still there. It's really crowded when I visit this place but it's still acceptable."
153,"Technically it’s Just a mall with a gigantic waterfall in the middle. Don’t go if u have ur baggages with u, not safe."
154,"This massive shopping centre had the most amazing waterfall and botanical gardens. There was an option to purchase tickets to walk across the Canopy bridge,  which was very high up with a glass floor. Amazing. In addition to this, we purchased tickets for the Sky nets, which are walk over nets, suspended over the top of the centre, scary yet thrilling. Definitely an adrenaline rush. Included within the ticket was the discovery slides, foggy bowls and topiary walks. I felt like a kid again. Great fun and great value."
155,"Visit Jewel was an amazing experience. Very well designed and planned. The indoor waterfall is just wonderful and the attractions on the 5th floor are good for a kids day out. Canopy Bridge, Sky Bouncing were the call out attractions."
156,"Jewel is a place for shopping different brands and different restaurants with many delicacies. In the central part of Jewel is a huge waterfall kind of attraction surrounded by floors of garden like view. Beautiful scenario. At night there is also a light show with music at the same place which is amazing view. At the top floor of the Jewel there is canopy park which includes entrance fee and some other activities too which are also paid ones. But overall experience is really nice. A must visit place. Anyone who is visiting Singapore don't miss it. You can even visit it before leaving, if you can plan at least an hour or two hours your actual arrival time to the airport. Its worth it."
157,"Visiting the waterfall is a must. I wouldn't recommend eating here though, it's very expensive compared to downtown."
158,"Read a lot about this water feature and the shopping areas but when I finally visited, I must say I am disappointed.  

Singapore had a similar water feature at the Suntec city previously and this just seems to be a relocated unit!  Sound system is so bad and smells of bad chemicals when near it.  5 minutes was all I can handle."
159,its unbelieveable what thy done there !! another superlative buliding the still blasts singapore one of the top cities of the world ! must see plan about 3 hours.
160,"I recommend hanging around jewel at night as the main attraction, rain vortex, looks a lot better at night and they have a light show around that timing too. There is so much shopping you can do there. Besides, shake shack is there too!"
161,Wow impressive what a great place to spend a few hours if stopping in Singapore or actually visiting Singapore.. amazing shops and food outlets to satisfy every taste. Located adjacent to Terminal 3 next to Crowne Plaza Changi... fantastic well worth the visit great festive deco for Christmas ...
162,"The rain Vortex, Canopy Park the greenery inside will mesmerize you. This place is beautiful and  attractive. Lots's of different different cuisines, window shopping is my favorite :P  and the trains passing by it is awesome.  It's hard to write how I felt when I was there so would recommend  you all to go and have fun in Jewel Changi Airport."
163,"I heard so much about Jewel and it did seem like an interesting place to visit. 
The place was really overcrowded and it was just very very noisy. Thankfully I had my noise cancelling earphones with me and kept plugged in during my visit. 
Some shops were cramped and were split over 2 floors, they’re accessible by stairs, not the most convenient for my 75 year old mom, but they might have been targeting the younger crowd with more disposable income in this case. 
It’s just like any overcrowded new mall in this case, which was unfortunate. We left after half an hour."
164,"It is a breath taking and an amazing place to visit, it is worth stopping over at Singapore just for this magnificent place"
165,"Its not just another shopping mall. Its a place where you can visit attractions, experience and do different activities. There are lots of indoor greenery, with exotic plants to explore, activities that you can do (located on the 4th and 5th floors), have a meal with a view of"
166,"The Rain Vortex or indoor fall is an absolute marvel of architecture and design, beautiful terraces of surrounding rainforest makes it an amazing place to visit."
167,"The new airport is really beautiful with indoor waterfalls and plants and there are lots of newly opened shops and restaurants. However, it is rather crowded due to the influx of travelers hence might have to queue for some restaurants. Recommended to visit if you're stopping in"
168,"Per most guide books, sounds like this place is very near to T2. However, this is misleading! It involves quite some walk from T2, though connected with a bridge. Today with a flight delay, thus spare enough time to visit this place.  If you plan to take a quick look before"
169,"The lighting show was good, but long waiting ended in 3 minutes.  Considering traveling all the way from tao payoh to Changi just for 3 minute show just not worth it.  To me, mbs still the best compare to jewel and Sentosa.  However no doubt, the food here is nice.  "
170,Jewel is a must go attraction if u are a tourist. The waterfall is magnificent. Sad to say that the retail shops and restaurant service in Jewel is not up to standard. It’s jus a typical shopping mall.
171,"A must visit if stopping over or flying in or out of Singapore,s Changi Airport.So much to see,plenty for everybody to see and do. Truly this should not be missed."
172,"My second visit here. I arrived in changi airport 4 hour earlier to see Jewel again. Jewel changi is another big mall that is attracting lots of passengers. It can be approached from the third floor of terminal 3 or 2 via wakalator or from taxi or grab, you can go straight from ground floor. It has most of the exclusive brand store, fast food, restaurant found in Singapore all in the mall. Most important, it had a waterfall that is artifically made surrounded by rich flora and fona. With canopy walk making it Singapore’s newest attraction. Its Starbuck has a tumbler with lighting and only exclusive to this Jewel Starbuck."
173,"What a jewel! The worlds greatest airport, just got even better! The activities on the 5th floor were fun and amazing. Highly recommended  Now, looking forward to going to the airport early. Wow!"
174,"We were so amazed of the Changi airport, the jewel, rain vortex was so beautiful!!! It’s a easy walk from terminal 3 atleast 15 minute.. I would recommend to come and visit the jewel whenever you have you have a chance!!!"
175,we arrived at Terminal 2 Changi so we headed to Jewel by walking which is at Terminal 1. I guessed we were just want to look around and have fun while taking the refreshing mist from the water fall
176,"Jewel Changi Airport is a separate structure with convenient access only for airline passengers in Terminal 1.  For passengers in Terminal 2 and 3, it is a 5 to 10 minutes walk via the link bridges.  Passengers in Terminal 4 have to go to Terminal 2 first by Airport Shuttle Bus"
177,The Jewel at Changi Airport's Terminal 1 is an amazing tourist attraction built at a whopping cost of approximately S$1.7 billion for the transiting passengers as well as the tourists. Level 5 has all the attractions and of course one can watch the giant waterfall from anywhere.
178,"i landed at changi T4 which i should be transferring by bus to T2 & Jewel (no worries, the bus available every 5 minutes), but on the busy period, you need to purchase minimum of SGD 50 at the airport to enter Jewel (they dont have any entrance fee)."
179,The view of the water vortex is really amazing! Transfers from different airport terminals is no fuss and a visit to this airport is truly worth it. 
180,"We are regular visitors of Jewel as this is a nice option to entertain before taking flights, especially at night. We really enjoy the canopy and our kids love to do the bouncing over there.
The rain vortex is the main attraction, and remains always impressive to see.
What a surprise to discover that for Christmas, the rain vortex was closed on L1 and L2 ! They ask you to get a receipt with 50 SGD spending to get a view of what has always been in free access until now... Even if you would abide by the rule, this is almost impossible as we use Jewel only a few hours before flying and don't have time to get to restaurant, get the right receipt, have it redeemed and then enter what should be a normal area of the mall. This is a very sad evolution of Jewel. Doesn't make good publicity to Shiseido to have their name associated to such a discrimative  endeaviour. I understand we have to pay for canopy which is an attraction. I dont understand why we should be prevented to wander in a mall."
181,"Is it an airport? Is it a mall? It's both - a mall at an airport. Jewel has everything except perhaps a casino - lots of eating places, shops, greenery, photogenic/instagrammable spots, entertainment places and fast, convenient connectivity to the airport terminals. It's worth your while to spend a couple of hours here either on arrival or before departure."
182,"Excellent place to be, even as a local. Not so much shopping as you can get better selection elsewhere, but for the ambience and the range of restaurants available. Recommended."
183,"A great place to visit and you could shop, dine, drink, laze around, hotel stay, watch movies and take pictures. Best time would be evening as the highlight is the lights/music/sights at the main attractions.  Only challenge is the lift which is very slow because everyone want to take it."
184,"A MUST Visit Shopping Mall, with a great view of the waterfall and great restaurants such as Burgers & Lobsters"
185,The Waterfalls at Jewel is amazing. We spent about 30 minutes at the waterfalls to take pictures. One has to pay to walk on the Canopy Bridge and enter the park.
186,"Changi airport has so much to see and do. It’s the perfect airport to while away the hours whilst transitting between flights. 

Our family of 4 had a 6 hour transit at Changi en route from Australia to London. We arrived into Changi’s terminal 1 at about 630pm. We could have easily spent time wandering around the many shops in the airport terminal but instead we took our cabin bags with us, quickly and easily cleared immigration and walked directly from terminal 1 into the new adjoining Jewel complex. The Jewel is housed in a glass dome and is a massive retail shopping mall that also has a few attractions. 

The main attraction is the indoor garden and rain vortex. We visited in December and in order for 2 people to gain access to the ground level of the indoor garden we had to spend 50 SGD in the Jewel complex. There was no other way to enter. I am not sure if this was because the indoor garden was lit up for Christmas, or because there was a special Christmas dance show on, plus regular (very short) light shows, or whether spending money in the Jewel is the only way to gain access to the garden year round.  In any event, it was great to see the rain vortex up close. 

We then made our way to level 5, which can only be accessed from lift foyers C and E. There are many bars and restaurants on this top floor of the complex, and it is also home to the canopy park and its attractions. 

The canopy park seemed to be endless and it was lovely to wander around it. There are a number of ticketed attractions inside the canopy park. My family enjoyed the canopy nets (there are walking and jumping options - we chose the walking nets because the jumping ones were booked out for the rest of the evening). There was also a hedge maze and a mirror maze, which we resolved to check out next time we transit through Singapore. 

Some things to note:
- Children under the age of 13 were not permitted to go onto any of the canopy park attractions by themselves and had to be supervised by an adult (thus requiring an adult ticket to the attraction to be purchased in addition to the children’s tickets). In our case, the other adult stayed with all the cabin bags!
- Entry to any of the canopy park attractions includes entry to the canopy park itself. Given one of our adults was staying with the bags and not going on the canopy nets, we were able to purchase “canopy park only admission” for 5 SGD for that person to allow them to enter the park.
- Canopy park admission includes a small number of attractions - the foggy pools (perfect for toddlers), the topiary walk, petal garden and discovery slide.
- The attractions closed at 10pm the night we were there."
187,"The man made waterfall was beautiful ,it also has a very short light show at night.There were a lot of restaurants and stores to shop.Overall it was quite nice.It is great place to take pictures."
188,"I go from T4 by bus to T2, then walk to Jewel and it is worthy. 
Amazing water fall (with light show at night), big shopping mall and many things to do and eat."
189,"A spectacular waterfall, which can be seen from within the Jewel or from the train transitting from Terminals 2 to 3. The train slows down as it passes by the waterfall. The place was very busy and looks like any other shopping mall in Singapore, except the waterfall. It is worth a visit."
190,"This is something you should do on any Singapore stay, go see Singapore's newest attraction, Jewel.  This great 8 storied domed attraction is a combination of a mall and indoor activities with this mammoth waterfall inside that flows from top to bottom.  I have no idea how tall it is but I suppose it's all available if you ""Google it"".  

We wandered around for hours.  Yes there is so much to see and it's well laid out plus it gave us the opportunity to have a ""Western"" lunch.  To tell the truth I was craving a milk shake and when we stumbled upon a Shake Shack where we indulged in a Hot Dog, Hamburger, Fries and a Strawberry Shake.  Just the type of meal you don't usually have in S.E Asia.  

The only negative I could think of about the Jewel is that there are many places to go or things to see that you have to pay for the privilege of taking part in.  You guessed it.  We didn't.  That said it did not spoil a good day out."
191,So much to see here. Come early and check in your luggage and you can easily spend around an hour or two here. Shopping is a little expensive as expected but we bought so many cute trinkets from the specialty stores
192,"We had just arrived from Australia and it said we had to spend $50 at participating stores to  get into the Jewel for a Christmas light show. We couldn't figure out where we wanted to spend $50, and we had to store our luggage somewhere, and that would have cost us $40, so we decided to just watch it from the side."
193,"Singapore airport is like no other. There are two central hubs, the duty free zone after you pass immigration exit and this place which is on the outside between terminals 1 & 3.
Come early, check in your bags here and spend time roaming around. It’s like a day out before your flight. 
The water fall feature is impressive and up on the top deck you can buy pass tickets too all the attractions and visit the rope bridge the steam forest the mirror hall and so on.  There is a decent size mall and a very good food terrace area with every type of restaurant and bar, coffee shop and the ubiquitous ice cream shakes. 
We had 5 hours between hotel check out and flight boarding and we passed 3 of them easily here just milling around and having lunch.
It is well worth coming early and seeing any least some of this wonderful place as there is no other airport i have ever been to as interesting as this one."
194,A great place to relax while waiting for your boarding time. The waterfall in the middle is pretty amazing. Definitely a must visit place if you have the time to spare.
195,"I lugged my baggage from another terminal just to see what all the hoopla was about, should have stayed and enjoyed the coffee instead.

I was expecting an indoor botanical garden, but it is literally just a mall atrium that has bunch of potted plants and threes. The waterfall in the center is pretty, but not something worth going out of the way for.  

The scale is reminiscent of the Rainforest Cafe."
196,"A mall that us better than the malls in town. Armed with unique food and shopping outlets, and boosting a number of flagship stores, it certainly boosts Jewel as a premier shopping mall. with complementing facilities such as the waterfall and canopy parks, it certainly enhances the experience. Certainly worth the visit for shopping."
197,"Being a particularly wet day and having a few hours to kill, we decided on going to the ""Jewel at Changi Airport"".

What an amazing dome! Absolutely huge from the outside and stunning inside with an abundance of shops and restaurants. Unfortunately most tended to be on the very expensive end of the scale but nevertheless well worth a visit to see the stunning decorations and displays. The cascading waterfall was quite breathtaking and as day gave way to nightfall and the many coloured lights reflected of the water, it became quite magical.

Due to the very large crowd in attendance, photo opportunities were rather limited but that aside, well worth a visit."
198,"Airports, boring, tiring and a place to get out of! No so at Changi. The display of attractions such as the magnificent waterfall, the moving globes and other sights is a combination of art, sculpture and engineering genius, congratulations to all those involved in making this happen. Highly recommend travellers take time to stand in awe of these amazing  spectacles."
199,"My Singaporean in-law insist we go inside the waterfall part of Jewel, the new over priced over crowded mall of  chaos with extra luggage next to the Airport.
You need a $50 spend in the over priced shops to enter the Jewel waterfall. We spent this and more on four burgers ($80) and  had the ticket given to us by my Brother in law with QR code.
Get to the entrance and line up literally everyone in line gets to the ""gate-keepers"" is queried for ages , then walks away without getting in . 
Literally 10 or so people.
Weird...
When we get there the ""gate-keeper"" says we have to show receipts from meal , not the QR thingy (or maybe both she doesnt say)
Leave like the others, maybe they could organise / signage  this better or train staff or both.
View the fake waterfall  from outside and leave.
Just go to airport , it's better."
200,"Now I know why Changi airport has this title : it is incredibly clean, a beautiful garden and waterfall inside the airport, a shopping center... when you are inside the Jewel, you would even forget that you are inside an airport !"
201,"I’ve always loved Singapore airport and just when you think it can’t be more beautiful, they built the jewel . We stayed two nights at crown plaza ( the airport hotel ) just to visit the jewel. All the trees and noise of the waterfall , it’s just wonderful . A perfect example that anywhere where trees and water are added are just a people magnet ! I’m glad Singapore Airport authorities understand that !"
202,Booked with Viator. When we went to scan the passes emailed by Viator they were not valid. The staff at the Concierge were absolutely useless and unhelpful we were not able to go and enjoy the activity we had booked. Take the hit & pay on arrival. It was only when we were at the gate for the departure that we found the actual tickets in our email in a SPAM folder. Viator refused refund. We will NEVER use Viator again.
203,"The one and only main attraction is that insane water feature right at the centre of the jewel. You need to make the trip just to see it with your own eyes. It is worth the trip trust me. 

It looks so amazing in person how the water falls from the roof. You will be mesmerised by it. Around this water features there are lots of green plants and trees which is really nice. I love the whole feel and environment. 

At the TOP of the mall there are some activities that you can do like the slides, mazes, walking on the nets but all these extra activities you need to pay separately. 

This place is at Changi Airport itself so when you are arriving just walk over to check out the water feature. The mall itself apart from the water feature is just a regular shopping mall with the usual shops and restaurants etc. Nothing to shout about. The main attraction toon is the jewel or the water feature itself. 

I highly recommend this place if you are at Changi or if you are coming from anywhere in Singapore. Go see the place!"
204,This is an amazing addition to Changi airport. The waterfall is incredible plus there are lots of other attractions for families to enjoy plus some wonderful restaurants and shops too. Leave plenty of time for your visit!
205,"Managed to pay a visit to Jewel following an inbound flight arrival at Terminal 1.  A new, nice and big shopping mall! Just not my thing so .....  Visited and tried their food hall (food court) in Basement 2 called Five Spices.  There is a good variety of stalls and we tried 3 of them.  They are Saravanaa Bhavan ($7.50), Nasi Ayam Taman Serasi ($5.50) and Guan's Mee Pok ($6.50).  Of course prices are dependent on what you order.  You can refer to my photos.  All served decent quality food but as expected, it is rather pricey and not a lot of food  ..... understandably so given the venue location.  It is not a very large food hall so the number of tables are somewhat limited.  I would recommend that you transit over to the food hall in the Basement of Terminal 3.  Much better if you are looking for a more ""local"" feel and larger variety and more places to sit.  But if you are looking to kill time and to window shop or shop then this is it at the airport."
206,"The jewel lounge  facilities are quite nice and efficient. However one of its staff members looking after the catering and shower facilities Fhazli had a lot of attitude and put off many a passenger. I feel he needs to be retrained big time and needs to change his mindset on servicing passengers rather than show a total lack efficiency and disinterest. 
We used the lounge between 11 am and 2 pm OM 13th of December 2019"
207,"Did a transit at Changi Airport on our way to Christchurch last month and the information counter staff gave us wrong information regarding Jewel. She told us that there is a Entrance Fee of S$50 to Jewel due to many visitors. We out off the idea visiting Jewel 
On my business trip to Singapore on 11/12, we ask the cleaner and he told us just walk till the end of the Terminal 3 Check-In Lobby(Right Hand side)! It took us the most 10 minutes walk and here we are! 
Very nice place. The ambiance is good. The man made colour waterfall is nicer than most waterfalls that I have seen. 
The waterfall is surrounded by a lot of restaurants. 
Good place to hang around if you arrive early at Changi
Disappointed on the wrong information provided by the Information Counter inside Changi Airport Terminal 2 & 3 or my family would have check out on this place during our transit to Christchurch recently"
208,"But do keep in mind that you can only access it prior to going through passport control

The center piece waterfall is beautiful but too too crowded.
I wish they would do as Dubai mall and restrict the immediate area to paying customers. This way everyone is happy.

There are a lot of restaurants, retail shops, souvenir shops and cafes

If you're flight is later in the afternoon and you have to check out, you can spend some time here

Plz give this review a thumbs up"
209,You have to see this place to believe it. Luxury shopping mall with waterfall in an airport. I found it relaxing always a quiet corner where you can just chill and watch the world go by.
210,"Have heard a lot about the World's tallest waterfall so we plan our time here to have and shop.It is a nice tourist attraction, we enjoyed shopping sport gears and even Tokyu Hand's stuff after enjoyed lunch with lot of choices. Spare your time at Jewel Changi airport for few hours before leaving Singapore is recommended ."
211,One of the best airports in the world need I say more? Where else can you find a 10 level storey high airport?
212,"I was doing a mileage run from Seattle and had 19 hours in Singapore before turning around and heading home.  A few hours in an airport lounge doing work, 6 hours sleeping at the transit hotel inside the airport and then what?  So I cleared customs/immigration and walked over to the Jewel mall which is connected to each terminal by a walkway.

After walking around each floor and having a couple of beers at the Tiger Street Lab I headed to the Changi Lounge which I was able to access since I was using my Priority Pass card and had arrived earlier in the day. Access was quick and I was able to get some more work done at one of the tables.  Wifi was good.

Then back to the airport for my flight back to Shanghai and then Seattle.

Jewel Changi is a terrific attraction geared towards your inner shopper.  Lots of choices and the grocery store in the basement had the largest blueberries I have ever seen.  Jewel is a great way to spend a few hours when you don't have something else to do in lovely Singapore and want to stay close to the airport."
213,"The airport mall has become a destination in its own right! 

Noticed on our second visit though most people browse lots but spend little in the retail stores. Most are going for eats and viewing the huge waterfall.  Good way to while away an hour or two."
214,Check out the base of the waterfall at basement 1 (or B2?). The paid sky net walk at level 5 is also cool. Also the cleaning bots remind me of R2D2!!
215,"Whether your in transit or not. The shops surrounding it incl eateries are first class. BUT inside the jewel gardens, it’s incredible. You need to pay a small cover charge but the light and water show is incredible.  The gardens with suspension bridges will keep you and the kids busy for hours....."
216,I had read a lot about the Jewel before our visit and it looked and sounded great but I was worried that it would just be some gardens in the middle of a huge shopping centre. Essentially that is what it is but nothing prepares you for the scale of the place and it far exceeded even my best expectations. We had a long layover at Changi so booked a room at Yotel (in the Jewel itself) and then had several hours to look around and enjoy this attraction. There is a left luggage facility here so you don’t have to lug your bags around all day and many airlines have an early check-in facility actually in the Jewel so you can get rid of your bags when you are ready without having to go in to the airport terminals. Even if you are not a huge fan of shopping (we aren’t) there is enough going on here to keep your interest. The Shiseido Forest Valley (and walking trails) and view of the Rain Vortex are beautiful and mesmerising and both are free but there are also some paid attractions (they are not overly expensive). There are also loads of really good places to eat and drink. So a long airport layover doesn’t have to be tedious or boring. Jewel is one reason that Singapore Changi is my airport of choice for connecting from UK/Europe to Asia and Australasia.
217,It is truly a picture perfect masterpiece. it is accessible in all terminals. nice dome with plants and malls inside. a must see when in Singapore.
218,"very nice to visit such a unique place, especially for an airport but Singapore Changi definitely does not disappoint. One of my favourite airport in the world. Can get very crowded so beware of the crowds. Restaurant selection is ok only and the popular ones usually have a very long queue. Go early or make reservation"
219,"Visited Jewel Changi when it was recently opened so it's still pretty crowded.

A good variety of restaurants, the famous water feature and the netting walk at the top level.

It felt a bit warm & humid during the afternoon when I was there, probably because of the water feature and the fact you can't air condition the place properly in such a big open space.

But it's still worth at least one visit."
220,We had been told about a waterfall at the Changi Airport so while we were waiting for our flight we went to see what all the fuss was about and we are so glad we did. WOW! Next to the Changi Airport is a shopping centre called Jewel and in the middle is a mind blowing waterfall!
221,"Consider this a PSA. I was excited to wander around the Jewel before my flight out of Singapore. However, following bad advice online, I went through immigration thinking that you could reach the Jewel from that side. Wrong! I only got to see it from taking the terminal train"
222,I loved the night light show from the top of the waterfall. Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I did the rope climb which was fun and a little unnerving when you look down but great time overall. Mirror maze was ok but nothing to write home about.
223,Jewel is accessible from all terminals at the Airport.  Check in for your flight and then wander across.  If you like shopping there is everything you could think of here.  If (like me) you don't then just walk into the middle and be wowed by the ingenuity of the largest indoor
224,"When you enter into an airport, it’s difficult to find a place that does not remind you of baggage claims, security checks, check in counters, and other things you fail to call amenities, with good reason. You are supposed to be in an airport.   Enter The Jewel and The Vortex. "
225,"Indoor waterfall, magnificent plants, flowers, shopping and great food! What more can I say. You must visit Jewel if you are at Changi Airport. Singapore is amazing."
226,"Jewel & Rain Vortex. I went there only for Rain Vortex, to witness the latest attraction myself. I end up brought my kids at the top floor and spent time with Skynet Bouncing and Skynet Walking.
The experience was superb! We got the nicest family pictures overlooking Rain Vortex from the Skynet. Everywhere was instagrammable worthy. Skynet Walking really tested your acrophobia. You will be walking on a net and below you the escalators for Jewel. Never look down! And tips for Skynet bouncing, wear comfortable cloth as you will sweat like crazy and when they say time limit is an hour, thank them please. You will get tired just after half an hour jumping and bouncing. Canopy walk during festive season is a bonus. Just love everything about Jewel and don't make make write another review just for shopping."
227,"Excellent building with variety of outlets. Its a place for everyone from toddlers to senior citizens. It can be used as family outing, for couples and also for schoolgoers to spend some time and enjoy."
228,"Tourism in Singapore starts right from the airport, and you are on till you board a flight out of the airport!!!

Jewel is has its own designated place between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.  If you are boarding a flight out of Singapore either from T1 or T2, one should keep additional 30 minutes to spend with this amazing waterfall.  If it is post 6pm, even better...  Follow the directions specifically marked for ones walk to this tallest man-made waterfall.  The other option is to take an inter-terminal train that passes next to the waterfall.

Whatever be the option, one should never miss this."
229,"Breathtaking. Visit this place for few hours on touchdown. Hotel check-in can wait.
This place is breathtaking, an inspiration to the new generation for architecture. The sense of a forest within an airport is just serene here. Coupled with a camera, leaving this place is difficult. Is this a man made 7 wonders of the world?
Customer service here is second to none as we shopped. 

Amazing Singapore!"
230,"When I landed in Singapore, I was in a hurry and saw a strange water flow. I took some extra time before leaving Singapore and visited this incredible airport part. You can have a look at the pictures I took."
231,"Don't miss this spot.  Huge artifical fall with great lightings.  Different feelings for day n night views.  The mall connects with changi airport terminals directly.  Shops include internaional brands, local names, many dining places.  Have fun in canopy park which locates at top floor. Can download ichangi app or buy particular amount to get discount for entrance fee.  Worth to go."
232,"But since it cost $1B+ that’s probably not going to happen. Beautiful building, spectacular waterfall, welcoming atmosphere - great restaurants and a good mix of high end and affordable shops."
233,"Who would have thought you would find such an amazing place in an airport but the Jewel is a must visit if you are visiting the airport, certainly if your'e on the way home from there, an amazing waterfall show at regular intervals, great places to eat the whole area great it looks like a tropical forest with extras I cannot recommend it enough."
234,"Simply breathtaking! Not only are you entertained with every step but you are also left awestruck with its fresh flowers, awesome waterfall and so much more."
235,"The waterfall and garden area is very nice, albeit very crowded.  But in the end, it’s yet another shopping mall.  Definitely whoa look."
236,Absolutely mind blowing. Looks like something out of a sci fi movie. Pictures don’t do it justice. Huge indoor waterfall & garden.
237,"This is truly so admirable sight! The engineering, the design, this is just unbelievable! What's more is that this is INSIDE an airport! This magnificent attraction is linked to three of Changi Airport's passenger terminals. This centrepiece is known to be the world's tallest indoor waterfall, named the Rain Vortex, which is surrounded by a terraced forest setting."
238,"We had planned on enjoying Jewel before our evening flight, and to us it was just another typical stopping makl, with a spectacular water feature.
We were able to find good dining, but once out of the dining places there was only a very small number of cushions on which  to sit. 
So basically nowhere to sit and rest.
We gave up and went to the departure lounge where we could sit.
The early check-in at SIA was excellent though. 
Wouldn't bother going to Jewel again."
239,"The Jewel is beautiful, it is my second time here and I am pleased with the cleanliness and the exhibits they have However, it is way to crowded. Almost everything has a qeue and there is a lack of seating area for tires shoppers."
240,"In our fictional depiction of utopia, we imagine being in a beautiful fresh aired nature but somehow clean enough not to bother ourselves with muds, dirt, and bugs. We fantasize  having dinner in a luxurious setting but surrounded by trees and waterfall. Only, this is not an imagination, Singapore did it, it's real. The best shopping mall in the world, the best waterfall/forest in the world. Putting modernization back to nature, and carrying nature to modern mode."
241,"The Jewel Changi Airport is the new attraction in Singapore. The place has a big shopping mall with many places for dine and shop. Its roof top has a garden, canopy bridge to walk through the air, sky net for visitors to experience both bouncing and walking at the top level. Some of this place has admission fee though, but if you have plenty of time before your boarding time, try them all!"
242,"Ambience: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Customer Service: 5/5
Physical Ease: 5/5
Value for Money: 5/5

Jewel. One might say this could be the Crown Jewel of Changi Airport, really takes your breathe away as one marvel at the beauty and excellence in the architecture. It’s worth making the extra trip here to just pause and marvel at the brilliance behind this building, this is possibly one of the hallmarks of Singapore Architecture!"
243,Absolutely incredible.  Be careful not to lose track of time as this place is so good.  Changi Airport deserves all the awards.  Plenty of good food options and things to do.
244,"Very convenient to come to this place by MRT. Specially if your flight is at midnight, it is good to come early and go around this place. They even have a movie house. Good for relaxing."
245,Go for a relaxing walk to Jewel Changi Airport after your arrival in Singapore. Here you will find the tallest indoor waterfall in the world as well as lots of shopping and dining options.
246,"This is quite spectacular, well worth a visit before you depart from Changi  Airport. Lots of shopping to be done too!"
247,Definitely not what I was expecting.  Absolutely loved the amazing indoor waterfall and vortex.  Whoever designed this is pure genius.  Also the gardens are beautiful and I love this area of the airport.  You have to see this to appreciate.
248,"We checked our bags etc in first & just crossed the road it was that simple 
we had a late flight the only problem we had that the  walk way closed earlier  we manage to get 2 light shows in so pleased we did has they was different 1 per hour"
249,"The light show is every hour starting at 730pm (830pm, 930pm) and lasts for 5 minutes. 

I thought the view on the second floor by the escalators was the best. You could see the waterfall and also the bowl.

Since the show only last for 5 minutes, it’s good to leave 1 minute before to avoid the jam by the escalators and get a table for dinner :)"
250,"Jewel is a really nice indoor place where you would like to take some time prior your flight. You will find plenty of nice restaurants Michelín awarded and others), stores and a cool indoor waterfall really nice and relax place. .. just be aware not to loose your flight as you will be so entertain there. Should dedicated at least 1-2 hrs."
251,"A must visit when in Singapore .so many shops, but go to see the waterfall and beautiful trees and flower exhibits . A place I will definitely go again as it is stunning"
252,Jaw drop amazing indoor waterfall and lots of shopping spots within the building. a must visit place in singapore which is easily accessible from Changi Airport
253,but beware that to get the closest and best views you'll need to buy a ticket.  Otherwise a beautiful and amazing waterfall in the middle of the mall next to the Changi Airport.
254,This is an easily accessible complex near the airport and you can also get there on the MRT Amazing number of shops and eateries and impossible to cover it all in one day. The central water feature is worth seeing at night although the show is very brief. a must visit when in Singapore if only to say you've been there
255,"The airport is well designed and although busy you do not feel crowded. The walking areas have plenty of space and well marked. The Jewel at the airport is a must do so arrive early for your flight and allow enough time to experience this unbeatable attraction with designer shops and restaurants surrounding a indoor rain forest, truly amazing."
256,"We had an early morning flight out of T4 so went to see Jewel a day early.  We took the MRT (so cheap!).  From the CG2 MRT station you can take the walkway to Jewel or do the short walk to T2 then take the train to T1 and walk into Jewel from there (all A/C and less walking).  We were able to take our time looking around and take the waterfall trails up for pix.  The best photo are taken up higher, not at the bottom.  Then walk back out into T1 and take the Skytrain to T3 - THEN you can take the Skytrain from T3 to T2 that goes THROUGH the Jewel for the closest view of the waterfall! (This Skytrain does not let off in Jewel, it only goes through it).  *Reference the Skytrain maps throughout the airport.  Also If you don’t want to climb up the stair trails inside the waterfall, go out into T1 and take elevators to each upper level."
257,"If you’re traveling to Singapore and landing at T1/T2/T3 make sure you have some time to visit the Jewel, it is absolutely beautiful! One of the airports where you walk around and you won’t get bored! If you’re traveling to T4 you can take a free bus to the Jewel."
258,"Ever been to a shopping centre with a rainforest and waterfall? I hadn’t until I went to Jewel, right across the road from Terminal 1 at Singapore airport.
Honestly the most beautiful shopping centre ever. There’s even walking trails around the rainforest.
And of course if you get bored there are lots of shops to pass the time in."
259,"We have been hearing about The Jewel at Changi Airport for ages now and one of our main reasons for visiting Singapore again was to see this beauty. 
We landed on Monday and took the MRT on Tuesday back to see this masterpiece. 
There is so much to see and do and eat and drink around the area. We discovered that we can book our luggage in early back for our flight as well. Today, Friday we leave and we are going to straight to the airport even though our flight is not for 9 hours just so we can explore and enjoy some more of this beautiful location."
260,The indoor waterfall is amazing and it's so beautiful! At night they do lights shows on the waterfall and it's such a nice thing to look at. Jewel is a massive shopping centre inside the airport. They have so many shops that you can spend 2-5hours shopping around. If you have a stop over and have a couple of hours to spare and enjoy shopping. This is the place for you.
261,"This has to be seen to be believed. Gardens, waterfalls, restaurants, shops, adventure park and monorail. Allow at least a few hours here and stay for light show. Light show not great but colored waterfall is impressive. A must see."
262,"During a recent holiday we flew through Singapore and knew that we had to take time out and see the new Jewel attractions at Changi Airport. It is yet again another piece of environmental amazement built in the garden city.

The water feature is like nothing I have ever seen before and the gardens within the airport are simply spectacular. You could spend several hours there so I would definitely recommend giving yourself plenty of time. 

‘Jewel’ also has kids attractions up the very top of the atrium which are a must to see before you leave this beautiful city. 

Definitely recommend this attraction."
263,Definitely one of the highlight of the country after Marina Bay Sands. Day or night the scenery is breathtaking and awesome.
264,Fun place to hang while waiting for your next flight!  The fountain is amazing. The flowers and foliage fantastic.  The bridge above was well not inviting to me. But others loved it.
265,This is an airport experience unlike any other; make sure you set aside time to see this when you are at the airport. Be sure to stay for the laser light show at the top and bottom of the hour!
266,"Jewel at changi located just beside the airport, the mall was huge, lots of shops and restos, the water fall was spectacular, was really worth it!"
267,"That's why Changi always being the best Airport in the world, they trying so hard to impress traveler / visitor to feel a difference experience on top other International Airport.. 

Keep up the good work.."
268,"We went to the airport early so we could spend some time at the Jewel.  Amazing indoor design for the waterfall, viewable on several different levels. Really enjoyed this visit and a great way to spend a few hours before your flight
On the top level there are several paid for areas.  We did Canopy Park which was reasonable at 5SD.
There is also a light show in the evening."
269,"Very interesting opening to an amazing SG vacation❤
The Jewel indoor waterfall is even more beautiful at night. There are a lot of activities for kids and very good food selection as well!"
270,"Even it’s within airport complexes, the whole designs and experiences did not feel like it’s in the airport. Can’t describe each and every attractions, but the iconic water fall is the must-insta-photo!"
271,"After a night in Changi's Crowne Plaza, we went to explore The Jewel. What a great place to sit, relax, walk around, enjoy excellent food and do some shopping.  If you only have a day, skip the city tour and take The Jewel instead."
272,"Just by terminal 1 and you can reach with easy 15 minute walk from terminal 3 singapour airport. The center piece is the waterfall which is very impressive and has light show and gives fog, good view from bottom to walk around and see it and the park around, on the different"
273,Very interesting that this is at the airport. Simply amazing when you enter and see the indoor waterfall. The top floor feels like a relaxing escape in a lush garden. Totally transports you out of Singapore and the stress of an airport.
274,"This is a large, upscale mall located at the airport but the waterfall is what really makes it special and it is best seen at night, when the colored light show plays off the cascading water. The water pours from the center of the roof into a multilevel amphitheater where every"
275,"On top of stupidity! Can’t go there when you are in transit, without going through immigration. But you are so welcome to buy anything Else. 👎🏻"
276,"Just opposite the terminals - plan your visits on beforehand so you can still check it in, after tax refund. Huge choice of top brands. Just amazing central waterfall with vertex, reminding of the movie ""Avatar""."
277,"This newly open mall, just open in Apr 2019, is a large convenient mall opposite to Changi airport Terminal 3. It has many interesting shops and restaurants but the most impressive thing here is the big waterfall with changing lights and the water flow down from the roof in such a magical way.  Recommend"
278,"When we landed at Changi we were very impressed by the Airport, so big and airy and easy to navigate.  But we did not have time to visit Jewel.

We checked in for our departing flight as early as possible and spent an hour in the spectacular Jewel.  Boy are we glad that we did. We also took a train through it - just great.

Do the same, you will not be dissapointed!"
279,"I’ve always wanted to explore Jewel Changi ever since it opened but never took the opportunity. This time, my family and I were to board a flight at night and we decided to have our lunch at Jewel which means we will be in the airport 7 hours earlier. There were lots of restaurants down there and we chose to dine in at ‘Sankranti’, a south indian restaurant. The restaurant was a good pick which I will review it on a separate post...hehe...So after lunch we chose to walk around and yes we only did window shopping as we weren’t carrying any luggage with us. Hence, we didn’t wanna do any purchasing this time around. Time flew as how it would in a usual shopping mall.Not to forget the main attraction, the indoor waterfall, it was an absolute delight to our eyes. Absolute stunning architecture I would say. The chillness and the positive mood was filled around. Not missing on the mandatory insta photo and wefies we took. Surely a memory to be viewed down the years. A little rest and we were ready to head for our flight. Missed on trying out the cinema there which I will surely wanna try on in future. On whole, this terminal is a good hangout place while waiting to catch your flight. Never regret if you’re too early in airport because you’re in the right place to hangout. Just be careful that you do not miss your flight as you explore this terminal hahaaa :D"
280,"You can walk from Terminal 1 to the Jewell. The waterfall is huge and the surrounding gardens and smaller waterfalls are awesome. Lifts take you to the 5th level quickly. Hundreds of shopping stores, supermarket in basement. No cost, but $5 if you want to walk over the top floor bridge. You do not have to eat at restaurants, there are plenty of steps and stairs you can sit on while looking at the huge waterfall. Go a bit early to the airport and have a look."
281,"Singapore’s newest attraction.This venue is popular & very busy.open daily ,Aircon ,WiFi ,toilets available.There is the amazing waterfall.plus various other activities to do,some charge a fee.Also there is a many cafes,restaurants,hair salon,barber,plus a cinema here.lots to see & do for hours.There is also a Airline Early Check in are plus a ECI Lounge all on the lower level.There is also a bagged hold facility( for a fee).Great experience."
282,"I went to the airport and had some time to kill, so decided to drop by Jewel and witness this stunning water feature. It definitely is wonderful to get to see it. The water sounds and the smell of it are amazing. If you stand close enough to the water, you can even feel the mist from it which is cool!"
283,"Over the years, it's got to be some sort of record that Changi Airport's been the recipient of over six hundred awards, for everything from ecologically-conscious design features to being best aiport overall in the world.  With fierce competition from other regional and international airports around the world, Jewel was the symbol of Changi's attempts to stay ahead.  I've been to Jewel several times in the last few months, the first during its soft launch when special tickets were issued and the most recent several weeks ago prior to to work trip.  At its most basic, I found Jewel to be a gigantic mall, like so many already in existence on the island.  An there are other minor attractions at the top-most floor that come with an admission fee. But the shops and restaurants were mostly a sideshow to the centrepiece waterfall located in its centre.  And what a sight - water cascading down roughly eight floors from the dome's ceiling down into the basements.  And all this in a garden-like setting that just shouts out 'island oasis'.  I believe it's been scientifically proven that there's something about the negative ions around waterfalls that makes people feel calmer and happier - think Niagara Falls or Victoria Falls - and ewel's waterfall is no different.  Having seen it in both daytime and at night, there's no doubt that I prefer the latter.  And it's definitely worth checking out the hourly sound and light show that plays several times  in the evening."
284,"From the international airport, you can catch a train that takes you from one terminal to another with the track going above the Jewel canopy and passing the waterfall. And that's it...
To properly enjoy this attraction you need to clear immigration (which is possible when in transit if you have long enough) first.  The large shopping centre surrounding the Jewel is quite quiet - it hasn't really taken off yet. It was nice to wander around looking at the waterfall - make sure you go to the base - one or two levels down. The shopping centre surrounds the Jewel in a circle so you need to go up levels in the shopping centre to see it all form different angles.  I didn't find it clearly signposted where to find each entry on the different levels so spent more time than I had available walking in circles trying to find the entrances.  Lots of places to sit and enjoy the calm"
285,The lights and sound show not to be miss. The show is just a couple of minutes but it is just amazing. Huge mall with restaurants and cafes. Love it. Im proud to be a Singaporean.. 😊
286,Little prepares you for the overwhelming experience of the Jewel waterfall. The is only possible in Singapore.
287,"On the advice of our Travel Agent we visited the Jewel at Changi Airport before our late evening flight to Christchurch. We are so glad we did. 
The early check-in at the Jewel was so easy and stress free which left us bagless and able to enjoy the wonders of the Jewel. It’s a vibrant and busy place with great shops, the most beautiful gardens and a spectacular, high waterfall. 
Don’t miss the Jewel if you have time to fill while waiting for your flight. It feels like a theme park and getting to Terminal 3 for our flight home was easy. Changi is a beautiful airport."
288,"It's absolutely amazing the indoor waterfall in here. Mesmerising... never seen anything like it.
Several floors to view the direct back to airport. 
I could have spent all day in here!"
289,"Jewel is the centerpiece of Changi airport and certainly deserves the crowds flocking to it. Several levels of shops and restaurants can be found , but the main draw is the Rainfall Vortex, a 40 foot waterfall dominating the centre of the building.It’s a sight with a high wow factor. Viewing of the waterfall is better at the upper levels, but there is some view disruption by a rail line, and a high level foot bridge.The best time to see the waterfall is after dark when hourly light and sound shows bring out the best viewing ."
290,Extremely well built and beautiful. Is a must-visit but go on the weekdays. We went there on the weekends and the place was shoulder to shoulder with people. The shopping centre is no different from others in SG but does have a few international restaurants and we realised the menus are not well designed for single travellers.
291,"It's surely an impressive feat of engineering and design. If you like me are wondering about what Jewel is, well, it's a shopping centre attached to Changi airport. 

You need to clear custom so if you are transiting for 4 - 5 hours, it's worth clearing custom to have a wonder.

There is an indoor bridge from Terminal 2 and 3. I can't remember seeing a connecting bridge from T1 or T4 so check other's reviews. 

Like most big shopping centres, there are shops, tons of restaurants, a cinema and a food court. 

In the middle of it is this massive waterfall that turns all pretty at night with changing LED lights."
292,"If you’re on the transit, depending on the length of your duration, they offer a walking tour for free. I took a different route but it seemed like a great tour if anyone is interested. 

I did get a chance to stop by on my way back to the airport, the indoor waterfall is awesome. There’s a bridge overlooking the waterfall, but there is an entrance fee. Apparently it’s the highest indoor waterfall in the world.

Many shops and easily connected to T1 of Changi. I would definitely recommend for anyone. I’m not certain the tour with breakfast is a temporary offer so I would check with the website if you plan to join :)"
293,"Located in Terminal 3, the Jewel is best seen at night. The world’s largest waterfall cascades down 9 stories through a dramatic 40 m rain vortex. The choreographed light show is another spectacular not to be missed event. The 14,000 sq m Canopy Walk located at the topmost level of Jewel is a maze of beautiful, colourful gardens, giant slides and bouncing nets"
294,Jewel changi is one of the best place to visit in singapore. Specially those who early check-in or who have extra time while transits. Canopy park and restaurant food are also really good.
295,"Fantastic. We got back to the airport early so as we had time to visit Jewel.  Easy to either walk or take sky train between terminals. 

A definite when at Changi airport"
296,"Jewel, great place to roam around in between flights. A big shopping mall with an amazing water fountain.

Got there around 8am for a morning flight and the mall was still closed. Only a few food stalls were open. I think they follow the normal mall hours.

Suggest to allot min an hour to go around the place. There was even a grocery to buy last minute shopping before boarding."
297,"A lovely waterfall to see! If you are not in the right terminal, you can use the free terminal transport services to get you there. There is a lift to take you to different floors so you can see The Jewel at different perspectives."
298,"We found out first hand last Sunday night that virtually all restaurants closed by 10 and a couple took last orders at 10:30 then closed at 11. This is despite the website saying many would be open till midnight. So if your transiting the airport like we were then schedule your visit for early evening if dining is part of the plan.

As all the reviews say Jewel is a good mall made awesome by the indoor waterfall and garden."
299,"We reached change airport and I saw a board called jewel and some type of escalators that were leading in. it is funny that I thought it was some kind of jewellery shop but after checking in our luggages, we asked the airport staff about it and he said that it was  a place like a shopping mall. There were many shopping places and malls. Amazing place."
300,"The first time I saw Jewel from the outside in the day, I jaw dropped as it is huge. I can't believe that CAG could create such a huge mall and attraction just beside the airport. And of course, when I walked in to the centre of the mall to see the man-made waterfall, I was starstruck and fell in love with it. Super beautiful landscaping of flowers and greens, cooling and the waterfall just so stunning. The subtle music just made it so calming and the Jurassic Park  entrance. I went to level 2 and 3 to take more pictures and sadly the top level is not open to public (need to pay $5 entrance).
We went down to go and eat at the basement and to our surprise, the waterfall continues all the way to B3. Super beautiful, so many shops and food eateries, local and international. Some restaurants have an outdoor sitting facing the waterfall too."
301,Beauty of urban forest hidden as a treasure between the trees. Must visit if you come to Singapore. Can spend 3-4 hours enjoying the beauty. Suitable for all ages
302,One of the new shopping malls in singapore which is situated at terminal 1 at changi airport. Lots of boutique shops and places to eat there
303,"Wow is just the word to describe this.
A waterfall inside the airport! Is this one of the wonders of the world? Truly amazing!"
304,"The jewel is one of the best iconic place when you're visiting Singapore with family. We can see the water is falling down beautifully, plants are everywhere so we can enjoy the fresh air in that area. Very refreshing just only sit down and enjoy the view and environment of the Jewel. You have to visit this place, very nice! :)"
305,"Surely, the Jewel is an excellent idea. A convenient connection to many shops, restaurants, cafes...The waterfall is also nice. The early check-in is a bonus!"
306,"The Jewel is marketed  as an all in 1 experience - there is shopping, F&B, a magical waterfall, movie theatre and even accommodation. Although it can be experienced both pre or post flight, (not after you have passed through immigration), it is best experienced prior to one's"
307,"Very attracting, very nice view especially when skytrain passby. You can take free skytrain from T2 to T3 or the reverse way. You must experience the skytrain as you will passby and close view to waterfall fountain. It was a good combination of Marina Bay Sand fountain of wealth"
308,"if you were enchanted with the Gardens by the Bay,  Changi Jewel awes you with its breathtaking waterfall and the indoor nature trail.  A place worthy of its name and worth the time spent.  The provision to check in early for any of your flights is definitely helpful."
309,"The Jewel is worthy of a visit, if only to see 'the manmade waterfall' which is utterly SPECTACULAR!! If hanging around at Changi (for an hour or two), use your time wisely and visit 'The Jewel' which is within easy walking distance of the airport (Terminal 1). Eat/Drink and"
310,"The Jewel ,the latest attraction in Singapore when you land at our Changi International Airport, a must Visit the Fantastic Garden in an Airport Terminal with Spectacular views of Lights and Sound .Plus Plenty of Food & Beverages Restaurant. Also the a Theme  Park up the the upper floor."
311,An excellent place to chill. Immersive experience of sight and sound never before seen. Great variety of good restaurants and food.
312,"its a fun place and a must visit for all. Santosa, Garden by the way & Mall - All in One. So if one does not have time to visit all of them, then this is the place where you get all of them at one place."
313,We were in Singapore in the month of June with family .what a awesome  fountain with different colour and music.It looks though you looking a movie shoot.No words to express it was just to feel.
314,"A great place for locals and tourists to spend time in.. lots of food places, retail shops and entertainment options.. connected to the 3 airport terminals, it is like a paradise for tourists to spend at least half a day just to explore and take IG photos"
315,This place is gorgeous. The waterfall is enclosed by glass and it makes for a neat effect. We didn’t have time to see any of the attractions. The stores were not too high end and we found some souvenirs.
316,"Aside of magnificent technology which discover glass waterfall, i think it was overrated.  Actually it just a common mall which equipped with artifiacial waterfall. It was suitable for region which doesnt have natural waterfall attraction. There were so many attraction in this area, but we have to pay high price."
317,"I was looking forward to visit the Jewel, its connected via Terminal 2 and easy access externally.  If you are looking for restaurant and little bit of shopping, a bit of long walk from/to terminal. The main attractive is the waterfall/fountain and garden.
You would not enjoy it when crowded.

Whether this is a must see place, it's pretty fair to me..."
318,First I must qualify that I was there at like 4am. Yes most of the shops are closed except star bucks. But it’s really peaceful at the area around the fountain. If you need a place to think and chill. That might just be the spot.
319,"If you arrive early for your flight you will have it made here. You can check in your luggage way early then put your carry on into storage while you explore.
***a tip for getting there from T2 or T3***
Don't use the covered walkways unless you like long hot walks.
Just use the SkyTrain and hop off at T1. The Jewel entrance is a short walk away.
Overall it's an amazing achievement  and well worth putting on your must see list."
320,"After reading about the Jewel and watching the construction on the internet, it was with some excitement that we visited while we were recently in Singapore. What an unbelievable location. It is not impressive enough that there are four monster terminals at Changi but linked to"
321,"During a stopover at the Crowne Plaza in Singapore, we were fortunate enough to have time during the evening to view the light spectacular at the waterfall vortex in the middle of Jewel at the airport, which I believe runs during the evening on the half hour. The light show to"
322,Lovely place to visit. Gardens By The Bay alike. Do stay to view day view as well as night view (esp the lighting show at fountain). Awesome and simply amazing!! 💖💖
323,"I had to spend 19 hours at this airport as layover. But no matter to boring feeling. So fun! So gorgeous! So brilliant! So clean! It's not just big airport in Asia, it's like a super city! The new symbol of this airport ""jewel waterfall"" is amazing."
324,This is an amazing airport terminal with the world's highest indoor waterfall. The early checkin facility is so convenient and everything is so well designed. The place is huge so it does require some walking.
325,"Despite the words ""Changi Airport"" behind the name of this property, it will take you a while to walk there. The impression that I got from the advertisement of this place made me think that it was an expansion of the airport building itself, which is not the case apparently. It was another different building with some walking distance from the airport, which could be the reason why it is promoted quite heavily with so many signs scattering around. They actually put the signs directing you to this place like literally on every corner of the airport; for departure, from the moment you get off the train you can see one of them, or for arrival, as soon as you claim your luggage, thus creating false impression that it's near. After walking for quite a while only you will find a redundant sign ""2 mins walk"" when you can already clearly see the entrance is right in front of you. Along the way I could hear some tourists concerned about the same distance going back to the airport, either for their flights or for train leaving the airport.

One of its main attractions is the first permanent (hopefully) Pokémon Center outside of Japan so for arriving tourists with kids who plan to visit there, please let your kids know beforehand about the walking distance.

Also, like some have stated before, it is just another shopping mall. If you are waiting for your flight and have nothing you would like to find particularly at Jewel, it's more convenient to just chill and dine inside the Changi Airport building itself."
326,"If you are in Changi make sure you go and see the Waterfall, it is spectacular. This huge waterfall pours into a sump hole in the ground and si surrounded by beautiful gardens. It can be reached on foot or by the monorail.
Highly recommended."
327,"I never thought that airports will be this interactive and a fun olace to stay! Not only because of it's one of a kind The Jewel attraction but all other things you can do here. Dine, aightsee and color! Singapore should really be proud of this airport!"
328,"Include this experience on your sightseeing  list if you don't have hours to wait in the airport. Its across all age groups, free to enjoy and explore the multi levels and beautiful gardens and themes. Easy to reach by MRT with a cross the platform train interchange for the airport at Bukit Merah. Lots of picture opportunities on this visit from all levels. Go to the top level for a variety of food and drinks, easily accessable for mobility impaired visitors. You have the option of purchasing tickets to enter speciality gardens, (this cost us S$5.00) or if you are visiting as a family there are activities for different ages and a variety of tickets at varying inclusion prices. Your  visit can take hours and be active or relaxing, all under a climate controlled glass dome with a stunning high drop waterfall and fantastic greenery themed for adventure."
329,Make sure you check out the Jewel before catching your flight out! It’s something that is so architecturally different it’s a must see!
330,We had a 8 pm flight but went to the airport at 5 so we could see the Jewel and eat a meal before our overnight flight home. There is an early check in here but unfortunately United does not participate but we found the secure luggage storage desk next door and left or bags that
331,We visited Jewel before our flight.  It was very handy to be able to check in early for Singapore Airlines at Jewel so that we didn't have any luggage with us.  The gardens are beautiful and the waterfall is amazing.  Eating places on the garden level appeared to be very
332,"Jewel Changyi is a place for final shopping and happy choice of restaurants in basement. Should spend time before your flight about 3-4 hours especially ladies(who love shopping). There are many brands such as Charles & Keith, Zara, Coach.     Then enjoy with amazing Waterfall"
333,"Cashier NOT FRIENDLY...not give some SUGGESTION SELLING PRODUCTS... Packer NOT FRIENDLY TOO,refused to give request for the chicken part while order.After explain to them,they finally gave my request by showing their long face to me. Plus still can say to me "" NEXT TIME if you"
334,"Now that the hype about Jewel is over, the crowds are gone and the place is mostly empty. While it is a nice and comfortable shopping centre, it is a total waste of natural resources that serves no purpose. You just need to see this place once and you can give it a pass the next"
335,Take the time to stop and see this at the airport before leaving to go to your hotel or leaving the country.  The magical waterfall that falls in to an abyss of water is breathtaking.  The height of this is wonderous and has to be seen to be believed.  Surrounded by more shops and eating places that do not impose on the waterfall area.  take a drink and just sit in the vegetation surrounding this and you will feel like you are on another planet.
336,The best airport-mall-forest I have ever travelled. It’s worth to spend some time there for some last minute shopping before you catch your flight. Bonus is the show during the night with the technical cascade.
337,"Getting there and back is easy enough but you do have to go through customs so take into account any queues and either the long walk or sky trains to the terminals.

We spent all our time at the waterfall - on different levels - and were able to watch one of the (short) light and sound shows.

For a fee there is a host of activities on the top level at the canopy park so if you really want to do everything that JEWEL offers, including food and shopping and the Attractions  - you probably need to be staying in Singapore."
338,"Most incredible experience I ever had. Dining, shopping, entertainment and everything. Just amazing ❤️"
339,I visited on my return back flight. View is simply amazing and heart touching. Must visit if u have time else you will miss your flight.
340,"I have been wondering how it feels like seeing this huge fountain with botanical garden in the middle of Changi Airport. So out of curiosity I went there as I have a lot of time waiting for my next flight. 
The animation was quite impressive but it does not compensate the amount of money they spent for this themed park (just my point of view) again it is impressive but it doesn’t have any wow factor for me...but anyways thank you for the nice show though👍"
341,"Whether it’s Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa island and now Jewel Singapore really do build first class theme parks/spaces. 

Jewel is truly impressive, the mix of lush plant life and the amazing water fountain is amazing.

On top of that you have an enormous amount of shopping and great restaurants.

It’s a must see whenever flying to, through out from Singapore. Travel out till the airport a few hours early, have a meal and enjoy the spectacle over a meal in many of the bats or restaurants. There’s s a great selection of cuisines across a wide range of budgets.

They first thing that hits you is the sheer size of the complex and water spout. Then your surprised by the quality and choice,

Ideal for a relaxing meal and rest after a long flight before heading to your hotel or for killing a few hours after checkout but below you flight."
342,"What a treat to have Jewel at the airport!!  I absolutely loved it.  The restaurants, waterfall, sky bridge to walk around the waterfall, a train that goes by it, shopping and more.  It was a wonderful escape to enjoy t he beauty of the place!"
343,"Just a beautiful shopping mall filled with dramatic green spaces that's connected to three of four terminals of Singapore Changi Airport. Its serves as multi purpose for travelers. There are plenty of diversions for travelers stuck in Changi on a long layover. But the main attraction is The Rain Vortex, the largest indoor waterfall and surrounded by Forest Valley, four story garden with walking trails and green landscaping."
344,Wow Singapore air port knows how to put on a show and keep you busy while you wait for your flight. Absolutely stunning the new jewel section. So many great things for kids and adults to do and see we ended up spending close to 7 hours in this section before we went home. Was not bored at all it’s truly amazing.
345,We were advised to go and visit the Jewel when we flew into Singapore and wow it is certainly spectacular! We have never seen such a feat of engineering at an airport before. Well worth a visit.
346,"I've seen this place whilst transiting through Singapore. 
I always thought it was a garden but no!
It's a shopping centre with a massive water feature. 
You can go up to the top and walk around.
Shops, food court and cinema.
WOW again Singapore on the way out🤗🤗"
347,"Arriving on a redeye from Shanghai, I got to enjoy the Jewel Atrium's vortex waterfall in the wee hours, without the bustling crowds. Sitting amidst the lush foliage with the gorgeous tessellated glass dome above, water falling, and the trams crossing through every so often--you literally feel like you're on set of an episode of Black Mirror--a glimpse into our utopian future. After Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay... Singapore's attractions, and Professor Moshe Safdie's architectural feats, continue to one-up each other. The Jewel is really a wondrous spectacle to behold, it brings out the child-like delight and joy in all of us.

That's all without even mentioning the plethora of conveniences and amenities on offer inside--shopping, dining, movie theater, kids activities, early check-in, lounge, etc. You could spend an entire day here, easy.

On a lighter note."
348,"very beautiful scenery with waterfall in the mall.
photographer must visit this place.
very impressed with the architecture & design."
349,"I planned to visit and left for airport 4 hours to have enough time to visit but unfortunately could not get entry to the attraction inside since they have lease the space for some private event.
many tourists at the same time was disappointed for such upcoming where there was not prior info or anything could see that it will be closed.

from far only could see the place and it looks very beautiful"
350,"Waiting for your flight at an airport is one of the most tedious things you could ever do. But not at Changi. Check your bags in up to 24 hours early and head over to Jewel for shopping, eating, seeing a movie, having a nap or just looking at the amazing sights. The world’s biggest indoor waterfall is stunning, as is the multi-storey rainforest. Catch a free movie or hire a pod for a snooze. Every airport in the world should have a venue like Jewel. We deliberately went to the airport hours before our flight just to go to Jewel, but it is an absolute must for those who have long stopovers in Singapore."
351,"I was on a long layover, so I had time to explore the Jewel.  It's attached to the Airport by an aerial walkway and has the world's largest indoor waterfall - a claim that I can believe.  It's immense!  The huge tower of water absolutely dwarfs the people around it, covering everything in a fine mist of damp, and is nested between terraces of lush greenery.  The roof level has a sort of fun-park, and the lowest level, where the water sluices down a tunnel of glass, has a foodcourt.  And the size of the dome has to be seen to be believed!"
352,"I visited the Jewel Changi Airport for the much publicity. The 40-metre HSBC Rain Vortex is the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. To get to Jewel Changi Airport, it is connected to the Arrival Hall (level 1) of Terminal 1, and also accessible via link bridges located at Level 2 of Terminals 2 and 3. I had a day off today so I decided to roam around leisurely and enjoy the Jewel, which has an ambiance of a large shopping mall. The jewel is surely magnificent but very crowed. The Jewel is very entertaining for families and even toddlers, e.g. Foggy Bowls on L5. It is mesmerising to enjoy the Rain Vortex. I have been to 5 out of 9 attractions on Level 5 (Canopy Park Attractions). I have enjoyed Canopy Bridge, Petal Garden, Foggy Bowls, Topiary Walk & Discovery Slides (the highest point in the Jewel Changi Airport to view the jewel from the top). The Canopy Bridge is great for people who want to release the fear of heights. If you are a fan of bubble milk tea, then do try The Alley (B2), for the Famous Brown Sugar Bubble Milk. 

SEE photos."
353,"If you have ample time, this is the place to go to relax, unwind and maybe have a chat with your family members or friends that travel with you. Away from the usual airport announcement of flight delay or change boarding gate. I like the water fall features and the garden and forest withing the building."
354,Brought my family to visit this place recently. Very stunning view of the rain vortex. Many shops and eatery. A must visit place for tourist after arrival or before departure. Walking distance connecting terminals. Even local residents flock to this place.
355,I love the early check in as we dont  need to carry along our luggages going around the jewel changi airport. A lot of food to choose from and we did some last minute shopping. There’s plenty of entertainment for kids to enjoy and adult as well
356,"Architecture, visual experience complete with nightly light shows. Ambiance and overall awe of the facility is really quite amazing. Even if Singapore is just a stop over you cannot afford to miss the wonder and exquisite design of this venue. The Jewel is for sure the central attraction piece, however the outer surroundings of the dome offer an amazing shopping experience also. But for me... the Jewel, the waterfall kinetic sculpture... is really quite superb!"
357,The shopping mall is modern with latest technology trend including self pay service in supermarket and car search location etc. The fountain is amazing!
358,"We wanted to see the waterfall before we left the airport, so after a really long flight from London, we made sure we checked it out. 
The airport is massive but well signposted. There's lots of plants and the sounds of the waterfall is very peaceful."
359,"While in Singapore we took a day to go back to the Changi airport to go visit jewel,which is the latest feature that has been opened just this year (2019). As we flew in late at night and planned to fly out very early in the morning on our way home 16 days later, we had already decided to take a day to go see this wamazing feature. It was one of the highlights of our holiday and I recommend everyone to take time to go see it. It has open and closing times."
360,"We love Changi airport as we have visited Singapore on numerous occasions and each time the airport changes for the better. In our opinion Changi is the best airport in the world and the addition of the Jewel just elevates it to another level. Shops and restaurants abound, but the Vortex steals the show - a must see. there is also plenty to do for children on the top floor of the Jewel with various themed gardens, slides and net walkways (height restrictions apply). We flew with Lufthansa and as a result we were able to check in our hold luggage 12 hours beforehand, along us to explore the Jewel luggage free. It's worth checking with your airline if this is an option for you.
The jewel is a must see for all ages."
361,"Singapore Airport is a great place to waste a few hours in between flights, we had 15 hours. So what better than to go to The Jewel. Amazing!
We arrived in Terminal 2 so although we were in transit, we had to go through immigration to visit The Jewel, not a problem.
The Skytrain takes you past The Jewel so you get a good view. Once inside you can view the waterfall on different levels. The light show is fantastic and mesmerising.
Lots of shops and restaurants. Well worth a visit.
Definitely recommended."
362,Changi Airport is always my favorite Airport from the whole wide world! It’s just the best and cleanest airport of the world. Also there’s a lot to do and eat in the airport which is the best. We always arrived 6-7 hours earlier than our departure flight to the airport so that we can goofing around in the airport. Believe me the time really passes promptly once when you get there. This year we went to Jewel Changi for a day trip with our Malaysian cousins and her family. Oh wow it’s so beautiful and it smells so good as well 😆 There were plenty of restaurants and shops to goof around. I finally found my fitness gloves at the Nike shop (it’s huge) over there which I’ve been looking for the gloves for ages! It’s hard to find the perfect gloves that you love! Also I got some Singapore snacks..that salted eggs chips very famous at this moment in Singapore and also the Eureka popcorns (geez they have lots of flavors) ❤️ I got the white coffee flavor cuz I’m a coffee lover! They also have the lightening shows which was incredibly beautiful! People who work there are all very polite and friendly which I love. The toilets were so clean which I love it too. Also the customs 🛃 here are also friendly and nice (not like in the USA which was always stressed me out every time when I got there) Singapore 🇸🇬 is the most friendly and cleanest country I have ever visited. Love Singapore 🇸🇬
363,"Looks like there is plenty to do here.  We dropped by to have a quick look before getting on our flight home. The waterfall setup is pretty good. Plenty of vantage points to have a look and take some photos. Also plenty of food and drink options around too,  Looks like it's setup for families to visit as the are many activities you can pay for too to kill a few hours."
364,"We had some time between flights and thought we would go and see the new thing. We found out that meant that we had to clear immigration and fill in those ridiculous forms - who though red was a good idea for a form with small writing?

After a Skytrain ride and walk and some elevators we found the place. The waterfall is pretty cool and worth taking shots of. We were really hungry so we looked for something to eat. And looked. We finally found a food court with 'local' food hiding behind an area of fast food places with stand up eating.
The foodcourt looked like it had been there for years. Cramped seating areas - perhaps all the space was used up with the waterfall. The food was average.

Finally sated we wander some of the mall - but it's just the same old same old.

Been. Tick. Return? No."
365,"This airport is a visitor attraction in its own right ,if only all airports were like this.the jewel is the right name for this indoor waterfall and garden all around it there are places to eat it is one of the showcases of singapore words fail me you have to see it!"
366,"If passing through Singapore, Jewel Changi Airport is not to be missed. It blends elements of indoor rain forest and amusements for all ages with ...well, Mall of America. And the result is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination. If possible, stick around after sunset"
367,"My mum and I flew to Singapore (day trip) from Kuala Lumpur. And after doing the necessary tasks, we headed back to Changi by MRT and with time to kill, we dropped by Jewel.  Jewel is accessible via terminals 1, 2 and 3 via foot (or sky train) and complimentary shuttle bus from"
368,"This place is incredible. This airport is a tourist attraction within itself. The indoor WATERFALL was simply gorgeous! The choices in the food court are vast. There is also, additional entertainment “hidden” in the lush greenery surrounding the waterfall. There is entertainment"
369,The only airport in the world where you can visit without sending someone off. So many eateries and shops. Indoor waterfall and a canopy park (entrance fee required). An entertainment place by itself. 
370,"Even with a couple of big bags to roll and tote along, it was worth the time to visit Jewel Changi upon arrival at Changi airport. I came out of T4 and I think it was about a 15 minute walk from the terminal to Jewel via a covered walkway. They have several travelators which will help you get there faster if you do it via the walkway.

I was invited for a durian steamboat dinner at a restaurant here when friends found out I was arriving at night, and I was happy to accept as I got the chance to view the Rain Vortex. I love waterfalls, nature or man-made ones, and the current world's tallest indoor ones was nice to view, especially with the lights and more so with a lights and water show at certain times of the day, until past 12:30 a.m. I think. Check their site for the schedule as it is not every hour and will be turned off.

Aside from interesting sculptures (huh? that was a rice sculpture?), near the top floors are also attractions, which I just whizzed by, having a very limited time to be here aside from the dinner date I had. But I would like to come back and explore more of the attractions such as the Shiseido Forest Valley, an indoor garden spanning five-storeys and the Canopy Park at the topmost level.

Although I did not get a chance to explore its shopping options, I am sure that those with some time to kill before flying off, or going into the city will enjoy checking this area out if they have not yet done so. It is open 24 hours, but not all shops and cafes and restaurants are open 24 hours."
371,Feels like you are in rain forest and not an airport. Keep two hours extra for visiting this place. You can take transit visa also if you are traveling onwards.
372,Already couples time here.but still amazed with this waterfull.modern unique inside a mall..the architecture they made really well think of
373,"Something not to be missed - just go and see the waterfall, feel the atmosphere - the serenity is amazing."
374,"Singapore airport never fails to amaze. The new attraction at T4 Changi airport, the Jewel is a definite visit. You can spend easy 4-5 hours at this place. Apart from the main highlight (Jewel), there are ample options for shopping, cafes and restaurants. It is accessible from T3 via a walking bridge. It takes around 15-20mins to get there. Other option is to take the sky train taking you to T1 & T2 in case you don't want to walk. It's a must see, you won't be disappointed. Very well designed and executed."
375,"I partook in the Discovery Slides activity at the Canopy Park last week. Whilst cruising down the vertical slide (which required a helmet and elbow guards), I slammed my head really hard against the slide. There was a customer service representative who had provided instructions to lean forward whilst sliding down and I certainly did as told, but still hit my head badly. I was disorientated and have been suffering from pain in my head for the past 1 week.Today I went to see a GP, who said that I probably suffered a concussion and he recommended I see a neuro specialist for a CT scan. I wrote a review on Changi Jewel's FB page, and they said they'd call to check in, but I have not spoken to anyone since. As I asked around, I came to understand that some of my friends had experienced the same thing.They too, had lodged reports with Changi Jewel. I'm infuriated to say the least, and would not like for anyone else to go through the bad experience that I've had to endure."
376,"Full of high quality restaurant and shops, the Jewel is a nice place to stop and spend at least 1/2 a day perfect for layovers. The waterfall and indoor oasis makes the experience refreshing."
377,Yesterday we  visited the jewel in Changi airport with one worth place to visit the main attractions is man made waterfall it is biggest one of this type of water fall in world apart from this roof garden with kids playing ground kids will enjoy lot besides shops and hotels are there
378,"Every time I came to visit Singapore, changi airport never failed to amaze me. Just putting an indoor waterfall is fantastic already plus the other attractions like canopy park, food outlets, shopping stores etc. Best time to go around 4pm until evening to see the musical waterfall show. It will make you feel cool and fresh after walking under the sun. Lively green sorroundings too."
379,A short visit is definitely worth it. It is a pretty cool place to spend some time. Plenty of places to eat and drink plus relax and watch as time goes by.
380,"Yay! finally got here in the evening and caught the musical show at 830pm sharp! The lightings and synchronization did not disappoint! We went to the higher floor (4th floor), less crowded here to allow us to get the unobstructed view of the whole structure. Have to be here to appreciate the massive structure, the design and the amount of work needed to maintain this space, it is massive!!  Cool and fresh here! So much green and water everywhere!!"
381,If you have time at the airport this is a must place to visit.. the waterfall is amazing and the place is very lively and green..
382,"Jewel is an amazing shopping mall with a beautiful waterfall inside. We just been there before our departure, and spent 4 hours there. Inside the mall, with a lot of good food and shops. But we really went there for the canopy. Unfortunately, only people above 110cm height can go in. So, my kid said she would properly went again next time!"
383,"The nature park and massive indoor waterfall are just a part of this shopping complex. We arrived early am and decided to spend some time here before going to our hotel, unfortunately a lot of the shops were not open. the gardens and waterfall are a great attraction, we enjoyed sitting and just looking for a while."
384,over 250 shops and lots of Eating places - not to miss is the top floor and Changi Experience studio at Level 4
385,"Visited Jewel with family and it turn out to be a shopping and relaxation haven.

The internal waterfall is very unique and nice to see different colors.

Good to go with family, friends or solo."
386,"This place is just stunning, with the beautiful fountain show and rainforest, I have never seen anything like it. Singapore really has the most beautiful airport and its so clean, and the staff are friendly. Can’t wait to explore more."
387,Magnificent five storey shopping complex opposite Chang Airport.   You check-in for your flight at the Jewel.   You can also leave your carry on bags at a designated store within the Jewel and shop and/or dine within the complex.   It is a very attractive complex with a 5 storey vortex fountain surrounded by rain forrest fall from the centre dome - most impressive.
388,"I was transiting through Singapore from Penang and just had to go to see what all the fuss was about.  
I had to go through Immigration as the Jewel is land side which felt a bit strange writing 4 hours on the Immigration Card for how long you intend to stay and Changi Airport for address but I guess the Officers are used to tourists doing what I was doing.
As I came in to Terminal 2, I had to wend my way across following the well signed directions to the Jewel as it is between Terminals 2 and 3..
The complex is actually a 10 storey shopping, retail and eating centre with the Rain Vortex in its central  area.  There are walks through 'rainforest' on several levels.
To enter Canopy Park (with admission to Topiary Walk, Discovery Sides, Foggy Bowls, Petal Gardens) there is a fee of SG$5 for Visitors (less for locals).  A must is also the Canopy Bridge where the cost is SG$8 for Visitors.  There are Kiosks where you can select what you want to do and pay online using a credit card.
A warning about the Canopy Bridge.  You can't bring cabin bags onto the bridge because there is a central section of the walkway made of strengthened glass which I guess they are worried about being scratched (or something).
One thing to watch for is that several times in the evening there is a coloured light and sound show involving the Rain Vortex and surrounding levels starting from memory about 7:30 PM or perhaps 07:45 PM.
Well worth spending some time in the complex especially with kids as there are areas such as the Foggy Bowls and the Sky Nets (Bouncing and separate Walking).  Areas such as Sky Nets and Mirror Maze and Hedge Maze have separate entrance charges which include the entrance fee for the Canopy Park itself.
A brilliant idea to entertain the bored masses waiting for their flights."
389,"The Jewel can best be described as a shopping mall in Changi Airport Singapore though you don’t have to check in and go through immigration first.

Given its walking proximity to the airport it is difficult not to want to pay a visit to The Jewel upon arrival, especially when there’s still a few hours to hotel check-in. From Terminal 3’s arrival go to the 3rd floor and follow the travelators beside the airport hotel.

The main attraction of The Jewel is no doubt the indoor waterfall and the greenery that surrounds it. The greenery is so lush that you can feel the air coming out of it. You can even smell the leaves when walking through the shopping center. The rest of the Jewel is a shopping center with well-known international brands. 

I think the shopping center is definitely made with airport-goers bringing luggage in mind. The walking space is wider and the elevator capacity is larger especially weight-wise. There is a place to safely leave your luggage but it’s not that much of a hassle to have your luggage by your side.

The only place where it might be a hassle is on the 5th floor where there is an outdoor food court and it can get crowded.

We went there twice. The second time because we had some time to spare before checking in into the airport. Definitely a place to visit and given its location, a place that you have a high chance of visiting twice."
390,"For me it’s a yes, hands down: it has a jungle in the middle! Tacking this on to Changi Airport means it’s basically game over in the competition for the world’s best airport but even when taken completely on its own merits, Jewel is simply extraordinary. I wish we’d had longer to look around the many, many shops to be honest...and I NEVER think that! It’s a stunning place."
391,"The opening of Jewel Changi adds to the already great reputation of the Changi Airport.  We had intended to visit this shopping complex (primarily to see the rain vortex) during our transit to Bali, but was told we needed at least a 5 hour layover.  So on our flight out of Singapore after a short stay, we went to the airport about an hour early, checked in our luggage and spent the time exploring the complex. It had literally everything, and to have a world class shopping complex connected directly to the airport was a brilliant idea.  Note you could also check in your luggage at designated counters in the complex for a number of airlines."
392,"It's not often you go to a airport earlier than you have to but Changi airport is not like any other. 
You can check in at least 24 hour's before your flight but do go early and drop your bag's of and go and do some last minute shopping or have a meal. 
The new water feature is spectacular. 
Easy walk or get the free train to the shopping area in which the train goes right past the waterfall. 
Around 5 floors of shopping and it's a good way to spend some time if you have a late flight."
393,"Jewel Changi is located at Changi Airport Terminal 1. There are many interesting things about this location, besides having a large number of restaurants and restaurants, Jewel Changi has the highest indoor waterfall in the world.  In addition, reportedly Jewel Changi was designed by world artists. Besides the waterfall there are many trees in jewel changi. So when you first set foot in singapore, Jewel Changi is your first tourist visit."
394,We had a 19 hour stop over in Singapore and decided to stay at the airport and not venture into the city. The Jewel has everything you need and more. So much food options to choose from and lots of shopping. Make sure you don't miss the waterfall light show. It's a must.
395,"It's an amazing place to visit. I arrived at Changi terminal 4. There is free shuttle bus every 10 minutes to terminal 2. From terminal 2, there is a link bridge that you can walk comfortably to the Jewel.  There are lots of retail shops and F&B outlets. Of course, you cannot"
396,"I deliberately transit at Changi Airport for more than 5 hours, when I was with my parents, my parents stayed in a hotel, and I deliberately searched for this place, many brands here, including up to date sneakers, you can find the sneakers you want if you hobby to buy sneakers."
397,"We visited jewel terminal and ended up spending 3 hours going up and down to see the massive fountain from all heights. The greenery takes your breath away. A well maintained indoor garden which has healthy plants , plenty of places to eat and to shop. On the fifth floor are the"
398,"Jewel was aptly named.  Beautifully designed, creatively positioned nature with man made wonder.  Shops, restaurants, cinema, the genius of it all.   Sure, it may only be just another 10 storey mall to some, but it is different in many ways.  It has character.  The efforts that"
399,"We loved spending the day here before boarding our flight home. Two kids aged 8 and 13, were thoroughly entertained by all thr activities that are available. Be advised....things like the bouncing nets in the roof of the centre need booking before you arrive. We loved the"
400,It was truly impressive to see it for the first time and it does look magnificient with the fierce water running down like a waterfall. Being such a big attraction in Singapore it is worth paying a visit. Took lot of photo and enjoy walking around the expensive shops and as
401,"We had a look around when we arrived. There are lots of activities to do for all ages, lots of shops and restaurants around which open late. The waterfall and garden is nice to visit and have a look at especially on the top floor to get a good view of the whole area. Lots of"
402,"I would recommend you guys to visit jewel! Why? There’s 24 hours foods and drink which is great for travellers who’s travelling to singapore ! And also jewel provide a lot of stores , and when night time there’s even light show , for more information about jewel shops directory"
403,"It’s beautiful no doubt. Lots of shops and eateries. Went to the Canopy Park. Nice stroll, inexpensive. The waterfall light show is a must do. "
404,We came early before our dawn flight and took the time to just browse around & check out the talk of the town center when all stalls were still closed.   Found the huge center piece of a water funnel feature surrounded by with nice foliage with restaurants on one floor and
405,"certainly deserve Changi airport and Jewel become the best airport in the world
their facility is alot more that we can use it.
Modern clean and clear information about everything.
the best thing about changi, it connect to rest of the world : asia, europe, Ausie, and even America."
406,Great experience and magnificent engineering. Yes there are lots of tourists / travelers but what would you expect in an airport. The shops are everywhere but you dont have to visit them. Worth seeing it
407,I have come through here at least a half dozen times and failed to stop and look. I’m glad that I took the time today. It’s a good place to people watch!
408,"If you are visiting Singapore,  before you leave changi airport you can go to Changi Jewel. Main attraction here is the rain vortex, 40meter high world tallest indoor water fall. There is a light and sound show at night and the water fall act as 360 degree screen."
409,"Love Changi Jewel, my daughter asked if it is the best airport in the world and I said probably; at least it’s the best I’ve visited.  Choice is excellent - restaurants right through to food court options, designer labels through to Muji.  

Lots of non shopping activities too”; rain vortex, canopy walk, net walk ( not great if you fear heights ) , cinemas plenty of ways to transit well.   

Only issue is it really 24 hours ? We landed at 3:30am and we’d told to stay in T2 because nothing but restaurants were open.  We of course went anyway; child was hungry.   At 4am the 5am and even 6am the only things open were the doors.  Five restaurants are 24 hr though they say ... well the one we found only served white / black coffee and only plain bakery items after 6am; child wanted the advertised the ham and cheese croissant but could only have a  plain one until after 6 am. I couldn’t get noodles or soup until 7am.  None of this is awful and when the food court options opened they were excellent for airport food but the Jewel isn’t 24 hrs."
410,It is a giant glass dome filled with plants and a giant cylindrical waterfall going from ceiling to floor. Also there are many areas to go to like the canopy park which you have to pay for but it is worth the money as you have many attractions and views within it. A good place to go for endless fun.
411,"Latest attraction at Changi Airport.  Too many tourists.
Wonderful sight.  With shopping area attached and restaurants to dine.  
Watching the flow of water makes you forget your  worries."
412,The Changi Airport is amazing! We visited Orchid park and we liked very much. It's a very touristy and shopping airport with a lot of shops and restaurants.
413,"Rain Vortex Jewel-Singapore Changi Airport:
- Wonderful
- Worth to see
- Free
- Majestic
- Next to Terminal 1"
414,Very touristy and shopping. Leave more time for transitting as it takes sometimes from Mall to different terminals
415,"It’s built in the middle of the shopping mall, very tall artificial waterfall, around 5-6 floors high surrounded by a forest like environment, very impressive! The shopping mall is located in between terminal 3 and terminal 2, easy to access. Don’t miss the chance to shop and"
416,"Jewel is an amazing place but don't go on the tour as it's a waste of money. You get to see the same great sights just differently via the bridge and the other ""attractions"".  Don't go on the Manulife skynets especially if you use their provided socks as it's just painful not"
417,"No other airport has this! The spectacular  mall connected to changi airport. Wonderful architecture, reflecting the “garden city “theme . High ceiling of course- the waterfall in the middle is the key attraction. Numerous restaurants and plenty of options for tourists buying"
418,Everything is there. However my overall experience was negative due to the large amount of people there (it was a long weekend). Everywhere I went had a long queue 
419,Visited during a stopover - its outside (not in departure area) - interconnected within Terminal 1 and 2. Its connected to a shopping mall - restaurants and shopping that's connected to the airport. Its stunning piece of engineering - great photo opportunities and stunning
420,"Just had a movie marathon on a Sunday at Shaw Theatres Jewel watching 3 movies in a row starting from 1030am. As it was a Sunday morning, bought 3 pairs of tickets for the price of 3 tickets using M1 telco 1 for 1 movie. Alternatively can use SAFRA 1 for 1 movie. Had breakfast, lunch and dinner here. There were plenty of choices for food options. Over hundred of restaurants and eateries. While there were sufficient gaps in between movies, you can opt to window shop at the various boutiques and outlets, take photos at the World biggest indoor waterfall, or sign up for some of the more adventurous activities at the highest floor. For example hedge maze, mirror maze, bouncing nets, walking nets or walk across glass bottom canopy bridge. And there are few bars at the highest floor which is a good place for beer or wine. I am sure you will find activities to occupy the day here."
421,Superlative is the word to describe this gem of Singapore. Makes most Singaporean proud lets go again
422,A must see when in Changi International airport. My breathe taking!! Very beautiful. There is a link bridge from T2 to Jewel
423,"We had a 9 hour layover in Singapore and I booked tickets for the canopy park before we arrived. 
The kids loved the indoor garden, foggy bowls, slides, walk nets, mirror maze- it was just amazing and then the sun went down and the place lit up! The light show in the waterfall was beautiful. 
The time flew by, I didn’t get to look around the shops.
There were plenty of lovely looking restaurants but I was outvoted & after 2 weeks of Vietnamese noodles, the kids wanted Burger King."
424,"We spent the day there, while waiting for our flight. The Jewel is beautiful with many different shops and food outlets. If you have the opportunity to see the light show at the water feature, don’t miss it!"
425,"A recently opened shopping complex located adjacent to the best airport in the world, Changi Airport. Free and nice waterfall show, plenty of dining option. So far couldn’t find any flaw."
426,We visited the jewel before a long haul flight. We checked in our luggage early so we could walk over a little easier. We were glad we did as although there were facilities for luggage it was super busy and would have taken too long to organise. The waterfall is incredible. You do feel like you are visiting a botanical garden with an impressive centerpiece. The rest of it is much the same as any other mall in Singapore with an good range of shops and restaurants.
427,"recently opened to the public this tranquill attraction offers a cool retreat from the heat. You might consider this a ""day trip"" if you are staying anywhere in Singapore. An easy metro trip to Jewel will reveal a delightful visual treat. With various levels of ""touring the Jewel"" you can see one or all the different levels of Jewel. Be sure to see the ""robo cleaner"". A quick snack or more and world class shopping and gifts are available if you have the time"
428,"Spend a few hours to see the World’s tallest indoor waterfall(HSBC) Rain Vortex, 4-Storey Shiseido Forest Valley,new to market shopping brands ,countless restaurants,and casual dining in the fabulous food court."
429,"What a great place to spend a day. Shopping, food, and really out of the world indoor water falls. Singapore never ceases to amaze you in what they can do, how indoor and outdoor boundaries are intermingled there. Amazingly done!"
430,"Whether this new comer can stand the test from the already excellent Garden by the Bay, Botanical Garden etc is in question, its entertainment level for visitors is high. The tremendous scale of the water feature must be another first for the world. The best time to appreciate its roar is when lighting is on in the evening. A must for tourist if you have time before boarding your return flight."
431,"For travellers with limited lay over time in Singapore, the Jewel is a great option to get a good flavour of Singapore without having to go down town. Lots of food offerings across budgets, have a shower, catch a movie, shop and shop."
432,True jewel. Take time to definitely see the jewel Mall at terminal 1 Changi airport Singapore. Apart from shopping and food the huge waterfall inside the Mall is one of its kind. You can spend the whole day there.
433,The crowd has subsided at 4pm saturday ..not so crowded ... But dinner ctowd returned from 6pm onwards.... Jewel is a dinning area for most locals... I noticed the early checkin counter has quence n hope this area can be bigger n tourists can drop their luggages faster to hv more time to explore the place
434,It is a vast and happening Mall. The water fall is a great attraction with changing colour lights. Most of the renowned brands have outlets. 5th Floor has many paid activities and pubs.
435,"Wasn't too keen on visiting a mall by the airport (!) but frankly this is a pretty spectacular set-up - a no-brainer for visitors with just a few hours to spare and quite the fun destination for a different family outing with Pokemon fans in tow... Access is also very easy with a well designed car park, something which isn't that common here... Overall, quite a fun shopping destination with a little bit for everyone...

I'm not sure I ascribe to the hype around Shake Shack - location is terrible with a very small restaurant with clearly not enough tables for the demand, leading to people hovering around the few tables available and the food not tasting as good as in other international locations."
436,"We stayed overnight at Singapore airport so we could experience all the amazing gardens and things we saw advertised but at the end of the day Jewel was just another big shopping centre with a big indoor waterfall (Rain Vortex). Lots of high end shops and places to eat but not really a lot to do there we didn’t think. We checked out the waterfall and garden, had lunch at Express Pizza, walked around the shops, went to the movies, checked out the L5 attractions (you need to pay for these), had dinner at Jack’s Place, checked out the Vortex light & sound show (which was spectacular), checked out some more shops, took the skytrain to Terminal 4, checked out the Petal Clouds (moving art work), took the Skytrain to Terminal 2, checked out the Kinetic Rain (more moving artwork) and that was the day over. The next day we had breakfast at the Pazzion Cafe Level B1 (that was a great breakfast), took in another movie at the cinema, walked around the shops again then headed to Terminal 1 to catch our flight. Other options to fill in time were to go on one of the Singapore tours (we had already spent 6 days seeing the city but if you’re just passing through then one or both are probably worth doing). The Social Tree and the Cactus garden were the only real highlights at T1."
437,"Singapore does it again. I really think Changi airport is a far away runner of best airport in the world. The jewel is an amazing architecture which you could just really sit there all day long and marvel at it. Aside from the falls, i really like a jungle atmosphere around it where you can sit there for hours and just relax"
438,"When we reached at Changi airport from Bangalore, we thout it better to see Jewel before passing towards departure gate as we could miss it afterwards. Although we missed the lift so my son had to stay with our baggage otherwise he could also have accompanied us. Many people were going to see it. It could be reached through travellator very fast as whole pathway
 could be covered by it too much walking isn't required. One must see it while arriving or departing Changi airport, its on terminal1. A 40m high water rain fountain
 could be thrilling with changing lights."
439,"The evolution of technology makes the impossible possible; indoor parks, eateries, shopping ""all in one"" - Jewel"
440,"It is a uniquely-shaped mall with an indoor waterfall and greeneries. The main attraction would be the Rain Vortex, which is the world's tallest waterfall, and it is located right in the middle of Jewel. If you are visiting at night, do remember to catch the free Light & Sound show! Seating areas are available among the greeneries surrounding the Rain Vortex where you can comfortably watch the show. 

As a mall, there is a large variety of shops to shop around. Also, food options are aplenty, so don't worry about not finding something to your liking."
441,It’s takes about 10 min walk from terminal 3 although you can access from any terminal.  It’s really beautiful from the top and looking down or from the bottom.  There are seats at the bottom and small seats where you can enjoy some quiet time enjoying the waterfalls and the green space.  It’s free unless you take a tour.
442,"Even though Jewel is next to/part of Changi Airport - it is a stand alone 5 Star attraction! We visited Jewel and was amazed by the following:
1. Although the indoor waterfall is its major attraction; and it is incredibly beautiful and majestic and perfectly designed, it is NOT THE ONLY attraction.There are activities for both adults and kids.
3. Viewing the waterfall - be sure to walk around it because the 365 degree view is well worth it! For those without the necessary time, I would suggest you quickly go down to the bottom floor and take in the 365 view; and then go up to the top floor and do the same thing! Well worth it.
2. For the kids there are two attractions(which adults would also enjoy) (a) for older kids, visit the Sky Nets - this is a corridor of nets, yes nets, hung up HIGH in the ""sky"" where one can walk along with the kids; very enjoyable; and (b) for the young ones, visit the canopy park where there are many simple but enjoyable things to do such as ""misty grass ponds"", animal kingdom walk...
4. For adults, there are many shops(including most brand names), restaurants etc that will keep you occupied for many hours......
Jewel is well worth a visit. It is joined ""at the hips"" with Changi Airport. Hence one could check out early, check in the luggage and visit Jewel: allow for at minimum 90 minutes."
443,"I am in totally in awe! Just amazing! No problem if you checked in early because you will never get bored just by staring at the calming waterfalls. Even the staff/concierge are friendly! Superb architectural design, amazing!"
444,"With the limited time that I had and no prior booking of any tickets,  decided to buy ticket to enter Canopy Bridge.  Got the last slot: 21.00-22.00.

So, it was a path where you passed through.  It has a see through floor, so we could see what was going on - beneath us, in the lower floors.  We could also take a beautiful selfie picture with the giant waterfall.   Take many of them as it changed colors ie blue, green etc.    

Recommended to see place.    Ticket cost only  SGD 8/pax (adult)

445,"Jewel is easy to access by crossing the street or by going down the escalator via the subterrean access of terminal 1 of the Changi Airport who was, is and will remain the best airport in the world. Inside the Jewel, there are numerous top~notch shops with a breathtaking 115"
446,"Ok, so the waterfall is impressive.  There are tons of restaurants, shopping mall type restaurants, lots of the same shops you see in every mall. The reason I scored it so low is that the signage is a nightmare. I just wanted to get to Terminal 3 and Crowne Plaza, but we walked"
447,"The latest It Place in town! Interconnected to Terminal 1+2 of Changi Airport, Jewel is a vast shopping complex with new as well as popular brands of f&b and lifestyle to cater for everyone's insatiable needs in this modern world, such as: ShakeShack, BurgerAndLobster, TimHoWan,"
448,"My family had a wonderful time passing by T1 while coming in & out of SG. It has a life of its own, we all loved how they blend the greens (the park and vortex waterfall) with a mall and an airport all in one. The tiredness was swept away by the amazing experience. Thank you SG!"
449,"Schedule your stop over at Changi Airport and make sure you have time to visit the Jewel. Amazing things in there, indoor gardens, the largest indoor waterfall, just spectacular. "
450,"If you really want to explore the area, you would need a day but typically a couple of hours should suffice. They have theme parks, adventure rides and a lot of other activities in addition to the rain vortex. Highly recommend taking a tour round it when you have 2-3 hours to spare at the airport."
451,Changi airport have gone all out to entertain Travellers and fill in those transit hours!  Make sure you allow enough time to visit terminal 1 to watch the spectacular water and light show. There are also many many food outlets and of course all the big name shops. You could spend a day just seeing everything. The butterfly enclosure in T3 also worth visiting. Although open 24 hours the butterflies are pretty quiet at night.
452,This is the worlds best stopover airports as it has incredible facilities in the modern infrastructure and this shows a true image of the independent country Singapore
453,"Changi Internatioal Airport is I think the best international airport that I've been to. It has the finest artwork and building design. 

The Jewel is a long walk from Terminal 2. If you are in Terminal 4 you have to ride a shuttle bus to go to Terminal 2. When in Terminal 2, there are signs to help you go to the Jewel.

The Jewel is the world's tallest indoor waterfall and the centerpiece of the jewel. It is surrounded by trees, flowers and various plants. Outside the jewel is a big shopping mall with nice restaurants.

When in Changi International Airport,you should not miss this free attraction."
454,"Jewel at Changi Airport is a modern, futuristic with a touch of nature is the main attraction of this new mall located and connecting the 3 terminals at Changi Airport. At its core lies the towering Rain Vortex, an indoor waterfall that stands and drops 130 feet high surrounded by lush indoor tropical garden and a canopy trail on top. The mall is 10 stories high 5 above and 5 below. It features more than 200 shops and restaurants, hotel, cinemas, check-in area and lounge. Amazingly, is it very convenient to get here, 20 KM from the city center it has many entrance and exits all connecting to Changi's main 3 terminals. It also has  the monorail connecting terminal 2 to 3 that passes thru the waterfalls. It is a picturesque relaxing mall with many shops, restaurants, and amenities not found in other malls in SG. If you wanted to go near the waterfalls there is a bridge that allows you to pass by for around 7 SGD and the Canopy park surrounding it for 5 SGD. There are many spots to take a nice insta-worthy shot of the waterfalls on all levels for a great memory of your visit. It even has a light show at night starting from 0830 PM to midnight every hour. Some unique and first shops in SG to open here in Jewel include Apple store, Footlocker, Shake Shack, Cafe Amazon, A&W, Maison de PB to name a few. The Shaw cinema is also located at the basement 2 near the food court. So there, if you visit Singapore, transit in Changi or lives here it is highly recommended to have a visit at the Jewel of Singapore."
455,"Often crowded, this mall is still great for families. The waterfall is the attraction. Lots of retail and food and beverage options. The tickets to the maze and recreational areas at the top levels are slightly pricey but they are a hit with kids."
456,You have to hand it to the Singaporeans.  What do you do to maximise revenue from real estate at the airport?  Build a retail and amusement centre rolled into one.  The forest and waterfall are spectacular and a great way to wind down between flights.  Lots of restaurants and bars as well as shopping.  Well worth the walk to get there from Terminal 2
457,"If you have the chance to visit the Jewel on your way to the Singapore airport be sure you don’t miss it. From here it’s only takes about 10 min to get to departure gate 3, so if you have some time to kill...... the fountain and the forest at the hart of the mall are overwelving...... so even if you don’t want to shop. Have your taxi drop you off at the Jewel before you have to check-in"
458,"Family outing. Eye opener for my 80 years Mother. Lot of choices for food. Beautiful build up. Spacious, well decorated. Waterfall is the main attraction! Gorgeous"
459,"This is a brilliantly designed shopping complex.  Even to the design of the walkways which are well and truly wide enough to accommodate people wheeling full-sized suitcases, and there were many of them when we were there (the complex is next to the airport and fully accessible for departures.  There are also baggage storage rooms available.)  There are absolutely endless food choices throughout the centre, and the waterfall vortex and surrounds are magnificent.  At the risk of sounding cheesy, this really is a jewel!"
460,"This is probably the most iconic airport shopping mall in the world. It makes tourists choose Changi as a stopover destination or causes them to prolong their stay in Singapore. It is also an entertainment destination for locals. A heartlander friend of ours takes all her overseas visitors to Jewel and Gardens by the Bay. In addition to all kinds of shops and restaurants, you also find a supermarket, a cinema, and amusement park-type distractions. Last but not least, it is very much in Singapore’s image - an thoughtfully-planned and expertly-executed garden city. Genius Moshe Safdie!"
461,This place is fantastic.  Not to be missed if you are passing through Singapore. Highly recommended. You will be impressed.
462,"This place is a massive tourist attraction in itself. If flying to or from Changi you must allow at least an hour to visit Jewel; it’s out of this world really! Or it’s even worth a visit if not flying...
It’s enormous and beautiful. And to think it’s just a free attraction in an airport. Incredible!"
463,"Being from the United States and traveling abroad often, I can appreciate how severely lacking my home country's airports are. However, a visit to the Jewel made me realize how far behind EVERY other airport on the planet is compared to Singapore Changi. 

Yes the Jewel is really just a shopping mall attached to the airport. However that mall has outlets of a large numbers of top restaurants (both ""high"" and ""low"" end), a huge number of retail stores, some great attractions, and at its core...OMG one of the most refreshing and delightful indoor spaces I've ever seen! 

When you fly out of SIN, arrive at least 5 hours early, take advantage of the early check in located in the Jewel, and walk around a bit. If you don't want to spend any cash, just sit in the waterfall atrium and soak in the gorgeous space. 

Oh and be on the lookout for the friendly robot floor cleaners!"
464,"Unbelievable. You should try and at least see the rain vortex. Catch the shuttle bus or walk over from the adjacent terminals before you go through immigration, or on your way out. Allow at least an hour. The whole complex is a shopping paradise with the water feature the highlight. Here is the suggested plan to get the most of the facility. Book your outward flight for the late afternoon, evening or night time. Allow 2-3 hours to wander around the complex, do last minute shopping and have a meal. If your shopping will be limited to carry-on items, then you can maximise your time by taking advantage of the early bag drop (up to 24hrs). Then just allow an hour for immigration and boarding time. Even if you only do it once, experience this complex and you will always wish all airports could be like this. Highly recommended."
465,Lovely place to waste away the time the waterfall light show is amazing and well worth watching if you cam
466,"Tourists or Singaporeans alike, there's something to do for everyone. Some tips we discovered that not many major travel articles have highlighted are:  1) They have early check-in of luggages up to 24 hours before flight, only for certain flight brands though. We realized"
467,Wow first time look at the new jewel attached to Singapore Airport. Fair to say spend an hour touring this place you won’t be disappointed. We have just done 8 hours here with a massage and some lounge time a wander and a bite to eat.
468,"One of the wonderful attraction in the world made artificially. Changi is one of the best airport we know, the latest attraction is the jewel and it is a man made waterfalls with lot of real trees inside the airport which makes it a mini jungle. You will indulge in this, if kids"
469,"A short 10 minutes walk from the T2 departure hall up, i arrived at around 2pm and it was crowded, not people crowded, but luggage crowded, there should be a better control..."
470,"Jewel Changi Airport is a very happening place with interesting shops and places to dine. Most eye-catching is the Rain Vortex that puts on several mesmerising shows every night. Even in the daytime, this place shouts of beauty and it’s nice to see excited smiles on everyone’s face as they pose against the beautiful backdrop of the 4-storey Shiseido Forest Valley & Waterfall. Fun recreational opportunities are also available inside the Canopy Park."
471,"WOW In a word 

The best airport in the world Changi has decided not to stay in it’s comfort zone and created a destination for traveling that the other airports in the world must be wondering how to keep up.

Dinning shopping cinema for entertainment and the Jewel is magnificent attraction in its own right the waterfall is special what a great adjoining attraction to airport 

This place is my favourite airport on the planet and look forward to returning for layover in three weeks on my way back to Australia"
472,"One of the best airport publiuc recreational facility in the world.  Simple, gorgeous, ecofreindly, modern, and more"
473,"My friends and I couldn't wait to visit Jewel Changi on our annual catch up in Singapore.  You could make it your base for a short stay.  There are many interesting stores, appealing food outlets, a Yotel and things to do.  You have to see the waterfall from many levels and catch the train that travels close by.  Even the public toilets were a wonder."
474,Changi Jewel has one of the widest variety of dining experiences for all ages. Plus a mall with a huge waterfall that makes it a memorable visit. Do stay behins to catch the light display that taked place daily in the evening. Its a visual feast that you won't want to miss.
475,"The jewel is promoted as a key advantage of the Singapore airport, and should attract extra travelers. There is however something that is not mentioned: international travelers that only have a transfer in Singapore, cannot make use of this unless you have 5(!!!) hours between your transfers, as you need to pass immigration and security  as the Jewel is only accessible OUTSIDE the international section of the airport."
476,"Changi Jewel terminal houses the world's largest indoor waterfall and is not incredible! The airport has many great restaurants and lots of great shops. The only disappointment with small kids is that most of the kids activities are for over 120cm, even the slides...a real shame for little ones. The night time light show is excellent!"
477,"Changi Airport is wonderful anyway, but The Jewel at Terminal 1 really is the jewel in its' crown! So many shops, restaurants & the amazing indoor fountain & rainforest which is at least 3 levels high. Highly recommended."
478,"Amazing indoor waterfall. The Jewel also home to higher end restaurants and stores. Jewel is accessible by general public, so it is crowded. If you want to dine here before a departure flight, I would suggest you make an allowance of at least an hour for the long queues."
479,"Walk to the terminal buildings.
Impressive architecture with giant waterfalls and indoor gardens. The air-side people mover also pass through it.
Supported by shops and restaurants (removed from the terminal building)."
480,"A huge shopping mall with variety of stores and f&b choices. Another place to shop beside typical orchard road,vivo city,suntec city and etc."
481,"Sometimes it feel sad when you need to go to the airport and be trapped there for how many hours before your flight ✈️ but here, this airport is truly amazing. You can go here early , have your early check in then go shop , stroll , eat or even watch movie 🎥. The best airport I’ve been so far . Internet is really fast . Very clean toilets with bidet ."
482,"Simply breathtaking. The jewel opens at 8.30 a.m. their light show starts in the night at hourly intervals from 7.30 p.m. onwards.

It's a brief walk from terminal 3 via the link way.

The greenery and the surrounding will simply take your breath away. One of the most magical places to go to at Changi."
483,"Accessible from all terminals at Singapore Airport, at the heart of the Jewel is a remarkable man made waterfall, which falls from a glass inverted dome into the floor way below.

Surrounding the waterfall are various tiers of green and a luxury shopping mall - an excellent reason to get to the airport early and pass the time.

Just an unbelievable end to a magical modern city experience..."
484,Its nice to take a rest in jewel. I will surely visit again. Its unfortunate that they now charge fees for the other attractions. I was surprised to find out the discounts applies to locals considering this mall is attached to  an airport thereby the chances of foreigners dropping by the place is higher.
485,It was nice to find another meet-up place to go to these days. When I return to my hometown we have chosen to meet at Jewel. Good for me to be able to see the beauty of this great big waterfall in Singapore. The water that flows down made the atmosphere less humid. The beauty of the landscape and designs that were thought so well during the planning stage. I have to admit the shops sold were very expensive. I shall return in oct 2019.
486,"Another shopping and food extravaganza in Singapore. Vast selection of food, shopping and famous waterfall. Check crowd on google before you go as sometimes it might get packed."
487,"My taxi driver and my friend advised me to head to Jewel before my flight. After sentosa, marina bay, the zoo, and the merlion, I thought I had seen it all. Luckily, I listened to them. I was happily surprised and impressed by it. Jewel had it all - Shops, food court, indoor waterfall, cinema, hotel, recreation park and easy access to all 3 airport terminals! It even offered luggage storing facility to passengers. It totally redefined my experience of waiting at the airport for the check-in counter to open. Instead of a boring wait, I could now enjoy some more sightseeing (the vortex waterfall and terraced garden were just wow!!! ), last minute shopping, and or I could just sit back and try some local food (vegetarian/vegan options available). Thank you Singapore! 👍👍👍😊😊😊"
488,"This is amazing! Make sure you leave a few hours to look around. Spectacular show. Very busy, but well worth it."
489,"While waiting for your flight, must visit Jewel of Changi Airport. Very nice place for shopping and dining."
490,"For a glimpse of what to expect inside the Garden by the Bay, you will see it here.  The Jewel will be the next best thing.  Every level and every angle is just absolutely breathtaking."
491,I can honestly say I loved viewing this spectacular indoor waterfall. It was amazing to see it and walk around. Easy access from the terminals
492,"Skip the overpriced food outlets and retail shopping at the Jewel and just head straight to the world's tallest indoor waterfall...the Rain Vortex. 
Captivating is how I would describe it.  
Surrounded by a beautiful terraced forest setting, you will end up just wishing this whole thing is in your own backyard!"
493,"The waterfall at Jewel is jaw-dropping impressive.  Situated smack dab in the middle of this five story shopping mall, it is a sight to behold.  We arrived late at night and got to see it changing colors and paid to go on the glass walkway at the top just in time to watch the show.  If you are flying into or out of Changi, dedicate a little time to walk across the street from Terminal One and take in Jewel.  It is worth your time."
494,"We had a midnight flight and arrived hat the Jewel at 1pm.  We checked in early at the Jewel and stayed there until 10pm. In all that time, I don't think we saw everything.

Stopped by at the pokecentre, grabbed a movie in the cinemas, ate Andersen's ice cream, shopped some more, did the mirror maze and various other things that came with the maze tickets.

So much to do and see, and we did as much of it as we could in 10 hours!"
495,Had to stopover in Singapore and was coming from Bangkok. Was recommended to visit Jewel and was not disappointed at all. It really is an architectural marvel and the main reason why Singapore airport is number 1 in the world. Would love to transit here again in the future.
496,"you will find it terminal 2.More on walking before you reach the area but when you already did  ,you will be amaze by the view, its really beautiful. There is a lot of things to see here a lot of fun games to do ,so make sure you have a lot of time. You can check the website because some area has entrance fee."
497,"During our three day stay in Singapore, we were told that we had to spend some time at Jewel, which recently opened in April, before our flight back to California. While the website advertises that Jewel is open 24 hours, we arrived at 3:00am (our international flight was at 6:00am) all all of the shops but a few restaurants were closed, the waterfall was not operating, and all of the lights in the rainforest and attraction area were off. Additionally, the early check in counter and luggage hold areas were closed as well, so we had to walk about with all of our baggage. There was something nice about being in Jewel and the airport at such an odd hour as it was empty and quiet, but it made for a disappointing Jewel visit. We were really hoping to view the waterfall in all of its glory but were unable to do so. We are certain that Jewel has a very different vibe when it is open with all of the shops, restaurants, and and attractions open and running. We would recommend a visit during opening hours."
498,An absolute modern day engeering marvel and its quite amazing to see how Singapore comes up with these new ideas to keep attracting tourists to this small peice of land.. the garden city !!!
499,"Singapore is one big shopping mall. And as with all things Singaporean, its done to perfection.
The centrepiece is a waterfall feature surrounded by lush green terraces.
If you arrive at the airport early you can wander through this mall to shop or simply pass time.
If you want to avoid another mall experience, go through security and leave it all behind.
As shopping malls go, this is a beauty"
500,"While most people think of airports as places of transits and stopovers, Singapore’s Changi Airport is a must-see tourist attraction in its own right. Its latest extension— Jewel Changi Airport— transforms Singapore’s world-class aviation hub into a truly inspiring lifestyle"
501,A mall with great amenities and indoor landscaping. There are many familiar retail shops and a wide selection of restaurants but it was just too crowded for me. 
502,"Lovely facility for spending time between flights; garden, water feature, shops, restaurants.  Unequaled facility for any airport in the world."
503,The newly open Jewel at Singapore Changi airport should be a welcome sight for airport travellers. Jewel is something close to an airport unicorn for weary travellers who have 1-10 hours to kill between flights. The centre piece is the world's tallest indoor waterfall named the
504,I think this is the best shopping mall and attraction that I have ever been.  I don’t know how to express but this Jewel Changi was superb and amazing.  Hi technology combine with amazing architecture and nature.  The best Singapore’s building after Marina Bay Sands
505,"The Jewel at Changi Airport is such a great space, right at the doorstep of the International Airport terminal. Packed with shopping, bars and restaurants, and heaps of entertainment for the grown ups and the kids - including an indoor rainforest and the world's largest indoor"
506,"The focus of this new destination is the high tech water feature. Apart from this, there are loads of high end shops and, eateries charging premium prices. Chances of getting run over or knocked by suitcases are very high. It's probably a good destination for transit or"
507,"Low standard cafe in Jewel , a latte cost $8 , but the coffee quality and staff attitude are make you walk way for it . If can MUST SKIP it , do not came here .  Staff are choosing customer to service , they like you they will attend you (especially you look rich) . I was at the"
508,"The mall is amazing, fantastic shops and restaurants. But... it is the most child unfriendly place I’ve ever experienced.   It’s impossible to use the lifts because they are too packed and for anyone using strollers or airport trolleys then it’s a total nightmare.   If anyone"
509,"As our flight back to Australia was leaving from Terminal 3, we had a few hours to explore. There is a link bridge from Terminal 3 Level 2 that you can use to walk to Jewel. You can see the world's tallest indoor waterfall and at night there is a Light & Sound show from 7.30pm -"
510,"Probably can spend a day admiring, photographing, shopping, eating and watching movie at Jewel... Plus having a cup of coffee, wow really satisfied and relax..."
511,Extraordinary experience. Big and very impressive. Full of plants and water which feels like an Forrest
512,"I dont mind if I need to transit in singapore bit more. We really enjoyed Jewel, they have everythings here. My kid was very happy for the fountain."
513,"I have never seen anything like this in all my years travelling and living abroad. It's truly spectacular and a feat that not many other places could pull off. Singapore has created a brilliant addition to the airport that welcomes arrivals home or to the beginning of their trip. 

The Jewel is a massive building that is directly connected to Terminal 1 (underground connection) and has 2 walkways to Terminals 2 and 3 respectively. Through these connections it's easy to access through public transport and obviously by aircraft. 

For travelers, there are plenty of places to stock up on last minute presents, essential items and brilliant food before heading off! If you are on a long lay-over head to the movie theater, Changi lounge or Yotel (it's a hotel...) to relax or drop off your luggage on Basement 1 so you can explore without dragging your items around. 

Obviously the shopping and restaurants are a high on must-dos at this location, but not to forget the center of the attraction: the HSBC waterfall. Right in the center of the dome stands a gigantic waterfall surrounded by lush vegetation on the outer walls. Take the time, visit it, climb the steps and view the waterfall from all angles and heights. Once you've done that, head up the level 5 and embark on some other adventures and hidden gardens (at a cost mind)."
514,We visited one evening. The centre was quite busy but manageable. The waterfall  is stunning. The kids enjoyed most of the upper level kids entertainment options. The mirrors were one of their least favourite activities. Prices for the activities all a bit steep. We will come back another time to actually check out the shops. Too busy eating and watching waterfall first time round. If your coming through Changi Airport don’t miss this shopping centre. I usually hate shopping centres but this one is quite an experience.
515,"An amazing shopping mall with direct access to the airport. Can check ur bags in early & enjoy a few hours at the shops, restaurants or Canopy park. The largest indoor waterfall is spectacular & the light & music show in the evening is a must see if u visit. I visited with my"
516,"As everyone seems to believe and know, Changi is a great showpiece airport. It's got all on would wish for in an airport...except soul and thoughtfulness for the traveller. So you can get into the airport and check in your bags with clever self check machines and even cleverer"
517,"if you happen to be in Singapore Airport, never miss to take a quick look of the Jewel. Relaxing greeneries. Accessible via walk ways from all terminals. Sent a good friend for flight and took lunch at Jewel. a are a lot of food and shopping options, but food is quite expensive."
518,"Finally have visited this ""attraction"" when I am on my way back from HK. Asked my family to meet me there for a walk  A huge complex with tonnes of food options For me, this is a must go place for tourists, to see lots of things in a location, plus foods (of cos)  The"

520,"Do yourself a favor and get to the airport insanely early, and hang out here for a couple of hours. You won't regret it."
521,I salute Spore for making this fake waterfall a tourist attraction.. The jewel is refreshing to look at and feel rather than just a concrete airport
522,"Prior to our most recent visit to Singapore, we had seen a great deal of online publicity about the opening of the Jewel at Changi Airport. Consequently we added the Jewel to our list of must-see attractions for our short visit to Singapore.
The Jewel is the brand new large shopping centre constructed adjacent to Changi’s Terminals 1 and 3. This shopping centre is situated within the public area of the airport. The focal point of the Jewel is the massive indoor rainforest with its huge water feature and light display located in the centre of the shopping centre. Therefore anyone who is in the transit area of the airport can only visit the indoor rainforest either by one of two methods. Firstly, they can ride the skytrain between Terminals 2 and 3 and actually pass through the Jewel’s indoor rainforest on the train. The other method is to pass through passport control from the transit areas of the terminals and gain access to the public areas of the airport including the new Jewel shopping centre.
Knowing the above, after a 24 hour stopover in Singapore City, we checked ourselves and our luggage in for our flight in Terminal 3 and then made our way to the Jewel, before passing through passport control into the transit area. As a result, we had our carry-on bags with us but this was only a minor inconvenience.
We only had time to have a very quick look at the shopping centre but it seemed to be quite impressive. However, we were able to spend a reasonable amount of time within the massive indoor rainforest area itself. It was about 8.00pm on a Monday night at the attraction was teeming with visitors. 
When we saw the magnificent water feature, the luscious plants and the wonderful light display we were not surprised that so many people, both locals and international visitors were taking the time to visit. It was just spectacular. We were a little disappointed that we were unable to spend more time there.
The Jewel’s indoor rainforest is highly recommended as a “must-see” for anyone visiting Singapore. We will certainly make a point of returning, the next time that we are in Singapore!"
523,"Went to visit Jewel in Terminal One of Changi Airport on 20th July 2019.  This surely is one of the latest and greatest show of Singapore. Water falls in a cylindrical form from a great height and the colour lighting in the Waterfall plays a havoc. The entire show is soothing to the eye. 

The entire water comes from Rain-water harvesting."
524,"New and entertaining, famous waterfall in the centre with musical light  show at night.
There are MANY eating places , all kinds of cuisine and many different shops including Mother  Care , Muji and higher end brand names .
If u are on transit at Terminal 1 , just walk across to explore ！"
525,"Changi once again confirms its standing as the best airport in the world by enhancing its entertainment facility with Jewel. This man-made waterfall is amazingly built to give visitor a memorable experience. All these can be found in an airport made it extrq applaud-worthy. 

Totally recommended to prepare an extra two hours time, either on your arrival or departure at Changi to enjoy some selfie time and enjoy the wonder yourself."
526,"Changi Airport is one of the best Airport and Jewel basically adds a jewel to its ranking !! So beautifully done. Each and every aspect of it you will enjoy from the Vortex, to the shops, gardens, walks, restaurants and everything. if you come here you have to try to get to all the levels. It may take you almost 2-3 hrs but its worth it. You can buy bundle packages for different attractions here. Day or night does not matter its just plain awesome."
527,the main attraction to this shopping center is the waterfall. Very majestic and beautiful. Lots of shops for shopping and food as well.
528,"On my latest trip through Changi Airport in Singapore, I was astounded by the beauty of this display. There is a fountain that covers multiple levels, and is worth seeing. The entry to Jewel is free, and can be accessed from almost any level as well as Terminals 1 and 2. There are shops and restaurants on five different levels. The rain forest on level 2 is also spectacular. Definitely worth taking a look when you are here! The Singaporeans have made this a display worth viewing more than once."
529,"I really admire Singaporeans in making their country worth coming back to not only once, twice but more often. Each time you come back they offer something new each time. Their airports T1- T4 is really world class most esp this Jewel its a tourist attraction in itself. I love Singapore!"
530,Jewel by name and definitely a jewel at Changi Airport. A must see if you have time. The worlds largest indoor waterfall. A credit to Singapore to have such an amazing display in an airport. In a separate building but easily accessible by skytrain or walk. Well worth the visit. Absolutely beautiful.
531,"The numerous plants surrounding the waterfall area create a hanging garden effect.  The waterfall display will occasionally be followed by the mist effect.  There is a left luggage nearby where one can keep a heavy tote bag for 4 hours at $5. Charges varies according to size of luggages.  We made our way to level 5 to tour the canopy park. We decided to do the Canopy Bridge tour on another day as it is better at night with the lights.  We installed the Changi Rewards app on the spot and gained admittance to the Canopy Park at $3 each.  It would normally cost $5 each.  The toilet there is impressive and useful for those with children as each cubicle consists of both adult and child wc and sinks.
There are many floors of shops such as a large Zara etc.  The foodcourt at B2 is reasonably priced.  It would be great to catch a movie at the Shaw theatre there too.
The entrance to Jewel is opposite to the arrival area of T1.
Definitely a must-see if one is taking a flight at the airport."
532,"I spent roughly six hours in this mall while waiting for a midnight flight, and can confidently say I walked back and forth over every square inch of it that didn’t require a paid entry. As malls go, it is very cool and you can easily spend an afternoon or longer – the waterfall itself is worth watching for a while, and the central courtyard is a relaxing (if crowded) spot to hang out in. The top level, with its cobblestones, greenery, and variety of restaurants, is also an easy spot to while away an afternoon. The stores are fine, as stores go, and there is lots of helpful signage. They also have early check-in counters to get rid of bags, and staff everywhere are eager to assist. It is very, very crowded. Very. Every restaurant has a line up, and none more than Shake Shack, oddly. Worth a visit for the waterfall alone, and an easy and enjoyable way to kill a few hours."
533,"This is possibly the latest and new attraction in Changi Airport with lots of shops, restaurants and eateries that attracted lots of visitors, local or tourists.

We happened to be here on a weekday morning after touching down from our 13-hour flight. It was 9.00am and we walked over to Jewel from Terminal 3, a good 15min walk. The directional signs are clear and precise and no issue navigating around. All T1, T2 and T3 and linked by covered walkways (and trains) here and as T4 is located further, may take the bus.

As it was still early, many shops and restaurants were not opened yet. We went by to the iconic landmark, the indoor waterfall, slated to be the biggest and tallest in the world thus far. It's nice and gigantic but I think night time view will be much nicer and more beautiful due to the lighting effects.

Luckily for us, it was not crowded and we managed to have some peace in the cooling and cosy ambience!

One can simply spend a few hours here, walking around, shopping or even dinning at the many restaurants and eateries, spreading over several storeys!

So whether you come here purposedly, or being here to catch a flight (or return from one just like me) or in the midst of flight transfer, this is surely a good place for you to spend time and chill in! 

Enjoy~"
534,One of the best new attraction in Singapore. Located at changi airport terminal 4. Have lot of restaurants and shopping around. They have a water vertex laser show of 5 minutes. Starts from 7.30 pm and with some even gaps they have around 4 shows in the evening.
535,"What an amazing place, we spent the day having lunch, shopping and fun with the kids on level 5
Highly recommended for day out in Singapore with the family, the waterfall is the largest in the world, it’s amazing, the gardens are great"
536,"Visited Jewel between flights and found a relaxing tropical oasis. The highlight is the vortex, an indoor waterfall however it is surrounded by a myriad of restaurants, cafes and attractions to help you while away the time. Because of ease of access you could also make a day trip from the city as well. It is well worth the effort to visit."
537,"Went on a weekday and I must say the place is a gem and that’s why they named it “Jewel”. The main centre of attraction have to be the Rain Vortex which gives a refreshing feel be it day or night. Shopping enthusiasts are in for a treat and be spoilt for choices as there are more than 300 retail and dining facilities. For those waiting for flight has an option to check in 24 hours before your flight and deposit your luggage. Everything about the place is about a 5-star experience, even the restrooms are not left out. Restaurants are designed with power point for mobile device charging or laptop use. There is a canopy park at the top level for fun activities and also cafes/bars there to chill out. Highly recommended place."
538,"I’m not a shopper, but I reaaaalllyy love the ambience at jewel 😌 the wide walkways are really rare in Shopping Malls here in SG, and it’s really suitable for couples or families to spend time together!"
539,"this location can be described as a forest located in the middle of the city, a great combination between the forest and the shopping center. the not only forest you can find a waterfall in the middle of jewel as the main attraction of this place in the basement you can find a food court but not all are 24 hours open. this location is best for you waiting for your flight because in this place you can drop your baggage in the check-in at jewel but not all airline can do this"
540,"When you are travelling into Singapore Changi airport, just a word of advise.. go and see the Jewel and next door. Its a fascinating creation that mesmerizing to the mind and soul. The view that you take is one of greatness and awesome creation in design and completeness..
Then you can follow up with the shopping at all the shops around.. Surely a fun place to be."
541,"Proud to be pioneer citizen of the pint size sparkling ""jewel state"" Singapore who has just celebrated its 54th birthday !
May not be as big as the elephant-size Dubai Airport in the Middle East but our Jewel Airport sparkles like a diamond under the tropical sun with unsurpassed records of social and religious harmony and peace!
Remember the days after 09 August 1965 when practically none would have come forward to support the building of Singapore's first airport in Paya Lebar ..."
542,"We had a long layover at Changi airport and went to visit the Jewel.  This is very convenient and easy to do.  Simply go through immigration/arrivals and it's a short walk to the Jewel which is a new multi-storey shopping mall.
From an engineering and architectural perspective the Jewel is very innovative and interesting.  The central feature is a large, cascading rain vortex/waterfall and lots and lots of green plants.
That said, it is really just a shopping mall and another place for Singaporeans to do what they do - shop, eat, shop ...It was very crowded and somewhat frenetic when I visited.  I thought that it might be a nice place to relax for a few hours between flights but I actually found the airport more relaxing.  Certainly worth a visit if you have time to kill but I would rather go into Singapore and walk along the river."
543,Huge shopping mall with the main attractions which is the rain vortex and canopy walk and recreational playground for kids and adults. There are 4 level above ground and 3 basement levels. Plenty it restaurant and you will be spoil for choice. Weekends is really crowded so better to hit this mall during weekdays.
544,"Changi converted a parking lot into a beautiful shopping mall with a unique waterfall and circular garden in the middle of it. Point to note, if you are on transit, you need to make sure you have at least 5-6 hours."
545,"The recently open Jewel is an attraction worth seeing when in Changi Airport. Like Dubai, Singapore have made its airport a tourist attraction. beyond the  many exclusive shops and restaurant, they have a theme attraction build like the garden and the forest. aside from the greeneries, they have an artificial waterfall coming from the top to the basement floor area, the water flow is protected by plastic structure, and the night view is just wow, with computer image and color. The different attractions are sponsored by big companies as commercial venture. It is worth all the time you spent here. Cometo airport early to check in and visit Jewel."
546,We visited the indoor waterfall and garden and it was every bit as spectacular as Gardens by the Bay. Definitely worth a visit if your on a stopover.
547,"This is the latest mega mall in Singapore. The unique selling point is that on top of the hundreds of shops and eateries, there is also an in-house garden with a beautiful water feature. 

It is connected located on the east coast of Singapore and is connected to the 4 airport terminals of Changi International. It is therefore very accessible by public transport, including the MRT.

This is definitely a must-do for tourists and locals"
548,"Rather disappointing. The only thing nice is the waterfall which is almost similar to the one at Marina Bay Sands. For an expensive ''mall'', it looks cheap. So many not so happy people working there. They shouldn't be closing areas for private events."
549,"Jewel @ Changi Airport is a must-go if you're passing through the airport or have a little time to spare before your next flight or even if you aren't going to the airport, visit Jewel. The indoor waterfall is just one of the many sights to behold in this large building. the amount of nature and greenery in just this one setting is beyond overwhelming. however, the lines are long for some of the shops during peak hours (namely shake shack) but there are other shops and eatery that you can visit alternatively. if you want to go to a shopping mall that has everything - clothes, a view and most importantly, food. then, jewel is the place to be."
550,"5+ Stars - while driving or departing the Changi Airport, allow enough time to visit the Jewel.  the Jewel is the largest indoor waterfall (I think in the world) located in a gigantic greenhouse type building that is also a mall/food court/etc etc.  It is easily accessible from most of the terminals by shuttle or walking.  It just opened in April 2019 and has become a must see for both tourists and locals!  When visiting you MUST go to the top floor and look at the waterfall from this viewpoint to truly realize the magnitude of what you are looking at.
Suggestion: plan on eating there and there are even locations that you can check in your luggage if you do not want to haul it around with you.   DON'T miss the Jewel!"
551,"As i arrived at T4 changi airport, one of the hype place was Jewel Changi Airport. So we took shuttle bus from T4 to T2 and then follow the direction to Jewel. After 5 or 10 min through walking bridge, we could find Rain Vortex. Don't forget to take a picture there. If you're hungry, there's many restaurant to choose."
552,Its really amazing. A place must go if u either travel to singapore or transit in singapore. Its just part of Changi Airport. Good scenery
553,"The highlight of Jewel is the Huge indoor Water Feature. Night time there is a light show every 30 minutes, looks really good. Watch your back though lots of people pushing in to get a better look also be aware of your valuables. There are lots and lots of shops on many levels, the top level has lots of really good restaurants and bars also some activities for the kids at a price though. We spent 3 hours here while we waiting for our flight, easy access to any terminal via the walk bridges or the light rail."
554,It's still pretty much a mall but its got some nice views of the waterfall. It's been super crowded since it has opened so prefer non-peak hours
555,This has to be another of Singapore's great attractions. We were staying at the Crowne Plaza on our Singapore stop over and Jewel is only a few minutes walk. The Vortex water feature is stunning especially the lighting display. Easily the main attraction. There are any number of retail outlets that cater for everybody. A food court and  many eating establishments.
556,"Sure it's slightly cheesy and definitely showy - but I can't help but love it :) 
I checked my bags in early which magically found their way to the plane.  I had a great meal, took some photos by the waterfall, and walked around the mall then hopped on my plane.  It was pretty busy at the mall. If you don't like crowds this won't be your scene.  Such a great addition to an already impressive airport.  Wow!"
557,"This is how Singapore Airport keeps its number 1 standing in the world for the best airport for 7 years running!

Its a must see not just for the visitors to Singapore but for every Singaporean as well!"
558,"I always see the news and hear from friends about Jewel, but I never get chance to see. One day, my Friend brought me there and check it out. It was amazing. Doesn’t matter from which side to see, it looks great and cool!"
559,"Our flight was leaving from terminal 1 so once we had checked in our luggage it was a simple walk across the road. On entering the glass and steel dome the first thing you see is the amazing waterfall that is the focus. It is surrounded by gardens, sky nets, a maze, as well as shopping and dining options. The monorail that links to terminals 2, 3 and 4 passes through this dome building. It was a wonderful cool and relaxing place to visit before our long flight home. What a marvellous place, and at an airport!"
560,"Singapore has done it again with this great attraction at the airport. Don’t think any other airport has anything like it.   High class shops, amazing water feature and light show.   My only complaint was that the shops close at 10pm. The food court in the basement however is"
561,"To me, its just another shopping mall with a gigantic indoor waterfall and some paid attractions.  I'm in awe with the gigantic indoor waterfall. Good thing is that it has a lot of viewing area. The paid attractions was slight pricey and doesn't seems worth it during a crazy"
562,"We spent a few hours at Jewel during our recent visit to Singapore. The waterfall is beautiful and worth seeing. There are many shops and restaurants. The place is popular with locals and certain restaurants are very popular, to the extent that there were long quese to get"
563,Jewel wow amazing visited here on my long stopover from Athens to Adelaide this place is incredible beautiful waterfall in the middle which starts from the the top and ends just before the basement many walking trails within the complex and many restaurants and shops which
564,Heard so much fanfare about Jewel and finally visited the place with my family. The HSBC fountain was def worth the visit. The 5min light show though short was enough to wow my kids. There are lots of food options on most floors. The TOP level is reserved for the sky garden and
565,"Jewel is new amazing indoor waterfall inside Changi airport. Airport itself have bar, restaurant, mini theater and many place. Not just traveler can visit but for everyone. Amazing!!"
566,"You may think that an attraction at the Changi airport must be for the tourists. Recent statistics, however, showed that 90% of the visitors to this attraction are Singaporeans. I am one of them who came here with my residents on two occasions.   On the first visit, I"
567,"Basically a giant shopping mall with a massive fountain centerpiece, and a roof canopy for kids. A couple of firsts though - A&W restaurant, shake shack, amazon cafe. And the second Apple store"
568,"Visited the Jewel with my two nieces who are in primary school. The place is quite a sight, just like a movie set. You know it's not real but it still feels like it. Go in the eve too when the lights are turned on for the fountain. The view from the Tapas restaurant is amazing."
569,The place is cold even there's a lot of people because it was the opening week when we went there. All other attractions haven't opened yet that time. Definitely will visit again. A lot of restaurants and boutique also!
570,"When it was first opened some time ago, I didn't join the crowd to be among the first to experience the inauguration.  
When the excitement died down is the best time I feel to sample the sights of Jewel that was located in Terminal 1 of Changi Airport.
I had arrived at around 7pm and left around 12am.  In between walking through the high end mall, I had a meal and watching a movie at the Shaw Cinema located at B2.
There are plenty of eateries and be prepared to pay a little or more than the normal fare elsewhere.  However I believe the fast food joint may or may not charge a little extra.  The queque at A&W was snaking when I arrived.  It was not that crowded elsewhere perhaps because its the weekday.  
Most of the public were enjoying the other sights and trying to walk the link bridge to other terminals.  And the rest were eating but not many were shopping at the time I was there.
I love the atmosphere and would be coming back to catch up with the rest of the attractions I have planned to visit."
571,"If you have a stopover at Singapore, do drop by at Jewel Changi Airport. The Jumbo Seafood Restaurant there has really yummy seafood. But you will definitely be spoilt for choices regards to the multitude of restaurants and food outlets available.

If you happen to arrive after 7pm, the waterfall offers you lightshows at 7:30pm, 8:30pm and every hourly thereafter till 12:30am, daily. Enjoy the sights and sounds.

Lots of shops for you to browse around too."
572,A nice scenic view but everything is expensive and overpriced. Worth a sight but not a single purchase for my family.
573,Sadly cannot be accessed when in transit...however if you have time clear customs and immigration and have a look ...allow plenty of time to check in again..impressive water feature dominates the centre and plenty of top end retailers as well as food outlets to please most tastes
574,"Heard about the crazy queue for some of the food outlets at Jewel, T1 but managed to get into this place on my way to fly out. The waterfall in the centre is impressive indeed, you can walk around not up close around the mall, many food outlets as well as shops - some are crowded some are not, but have no time to actually browse all. I paid for the entrance and went it and Yes the place is interesting to visit, children are happy where they can take photo, enjoy the mist garden (not sure of the name), and i tried the walk, visit the mirror area, spent about 2 hours - crowded and some place the queue is long so give it a miss. Good to visit during week day definitely not Saturday Sunday or any public holiday. Worth going again to have another closer look."
575,"The 40m-high Rain Vortex, that is expected to be the world's tallest indoor waterfall, is very amazing. If you visit Jewel at night, you also can enjoy the light and sound show with special lighting effects. There are lots of restaurants and shops there, playgrounds for children. It is easy to spend 2 to 3 hours there.

If you like Pikachu, you must go to Jewel on weekends in July 2019. There is a parade comprising eight Pikachu, an Eevee and a Mimikyu will be held twice a day on weekends in July 2019."
576,"Definitely a place to visit if you have a few hours to spare in the airport. Have a walk around, try different floors to see the fountains. The experience is just phenomenal."
577,"So i wasn’t keen on visiting a mall but my husband is an architect and he really wanted to see it. It had just opened and I couldn’t believe how amazing it was! It was very easy to get there from all the terminals. We had to get the little bus with our hand baggage and it was no problem at all. 
Didn’t do much shopping but the waterfall is amazing!"
578,"Very nice. At around 530 pm, Jewel is already fairly crowded. It is actually a huge shopping center attached to terminal 1. The massive water feature is spectacular- it gets nicer at night with colorful lights. Each level you get to see differs features of this massive water feature with indoor plants another mini water feature . Tis to travelers/ jewel is outsider the terminals so please don’t go inside departures hall or you will miss this jewel. You need almost 4/4 hours here as there are lots to do including walking on floating bridge. After you enjoyed Jewel
Hi 
. Check in and take the transfer train from terminal 2 back to3 as that train go inside jewel and you can take photo and see this water feature from the transfer train."
579,"get there early if you are departing, you don't want to miss the Jewel experience. See the biggest indoor waterfall in the world called the Vortex. This alone is spectacular, then there is lots of other things to see. Wonderful, wonderful airport. And if you smoke you will love the out door area. So you won't get stuck in a glass box chuffing away in a smoke filled room. Good restaurants, great shops. If you are just flying off it is worth taking a couple of extra hours just to see it"
580,"Its a must go place, very well engineered.  A man made wonder that really bring piece of mind.  They have more than one attraction and a lot of eateries and shopping option."
581,It's truly a beautiful building - Changi Airport Jewel ! The vortex is a sight to behold. Beautiful and even therapeutic just to stand there and watch the water flow down so majestically ! Also plenty of shopping and dining options. An enjoyable place to spend some time with the family. :)
582,"Spoilt for choice when it comes to food but it could be more appealing if they could have more international variety not found in Singapore yet eg Wholefood(US esp salads),Boudin (San Fran chowder etc) notwithstanding those  on the 4 level which is out of reach of everyday folks

The waterfall (fountain ?) is overwhelming initially  but after a few minutes of elbowing myself through the crowds(Sunday evening) it becomes less appealing.  

There are a  few critics here whom found Jewel  'no big deal' but I would ask which other airport could give you the variety of food ! if you have been to San Fran intl airport s Foodcourts inside and outside you would pp perhaps agree with my points. 

well done Singapore !"
583,"Visited this place after arrival..sooo amazing and its becoming a stunning  tourist destinaton since it was opened..beautiful landscape indeed.

We enjoyed our time exploring the place..."
584,"My flight departed from Terminal 1, so how could I not go early and catch a glimpse of the Jewel? It's a 5-10 minute walk from the check-in desks at terminal 1 and I was primarily interested in the waterfall and plants, which are pretty stunning. Going through it on the train must be a pretty cool experience, but I didn't have enough time for that. The place was still pretty busy at 10pm and with the many restaurants etc, I can see why, although I'm not sure that I would go there if I didn't have to use the airport."
585,"Well worth a visit for this amazing waterfall. It is only 30 mins on the train from Orchard Road. Good place to chill, take photos and eat. Not so much for shopping."
586,"JEWEL is the new mall in Changi airport. It can be reached thru walking hallway from all Terminal 1-3. The mall has mostly food but few good shops. I would recommend spending 3-4 hrs before or after your flights to truly enjoy it. You cant use the airport trolley though, so make sure you carry a wheeled luggage. The middle part has a beaufiful fountain with stairs on the sides good for picnic. The top mall has some park or outbound activities for kids. So good foods and sightseeing. No fee to see the fountain but the activities are with fee of ~SGD8-15/pax. For pictures go to their site."
587,"Was going to visit family in Malaysia and heard about Jewel from my mom. Since I hadn’t been to Singapore in years, I decided to stop over and explore. Staying in an airport hotel was a good choice as it allowed us a lot of time to explore the Jewel terminal. Convenient too. Just walk on over and lots of restaurants to eat at. Shops to visit with plenty of items to purchase. We stayed two days and although walked around most of the structure, we didn’t have time to fully explore as we did go on a couple of tours of the island. There was also a new attraction opening after we left so we need to go back. The indoor waterfall has a sound and light show which was cool. Unfortunately we missed some of it because we didn’t know what time it started and thought the colors the water changed into was it. That was neat too. Definitely head over to the Jewel if you are in transit at Changi airport."
588,"Since I arrived at the airport, the place and ambience was very nice. The personnel greeted us with a smile and the internet is very fast. The mall is filled with amazing stores and all of the toilets are maintained properly. Probably one of the best airport I've been through."
589,"no words, magnificent view and it was a great experience, I can say surely definitely it will be a different experience to the travelers. waterfall and  the musical laser show  gives u   heavenly feel, wooow"
590,Singapore has elevated airport development with Jewel at the Changi airport. No other airport in the world comes close to the interest & curiosity visiting Jewel Changi airport could bring. One does not even need to explore Singapore anymore. Singapore's wide array of dining &
591,"Having seen many photos from various sources since its opening, I thought I would not have as great an experience as those who have had a taste of this crazy attraction in Singapore.  Surprisingly, I arrived at the Jewel, feeling more impressed than ever!  The biggest highlight"
592,"It's certainly an impressive effort and deserving of the hype surrounding it. We visited with the kids on a rainy weekend day in April. Even early in the morning it was crowded, with an insane queue at Shake Shack and at A&W: haven't these people tried junk food before!? But the"
593,"I was interested to see the 'Jewel' at Changi when transiting through yesterday, after hearing so much gushing praise about it. However I was frankly left cold. You see, Singapore needs more shopping malls like an oil millionaire needs more Ferraris; once you reach a certain"
594,"This place is amazing, be sure to check it out if you have a long enough stop over at the airport or visiting Singapore.  The inside waterfall & rainforest is truly an amazing site. Heaps of good food options and shopping as well.  You will need at least a few hours to walk"
595,"We planned a visit Jewel and arrived at the airport earlier than normal and planned to have dinner.

It was incredibly busy as it was around dinner time and there are 100s if eating places. But worth working through the crowds to see the the Jewel and the HSBC vortex.

We managed to also see the HSBC music and light show which starts each evening every hour from 20:30.

Worth a visit to see the marvel"
596,"When we were leaving Singapore, after all the formalities we went to the Jewel
Only Singapore would built something like this in an International Terminal
Must see, interesting concept don't stand to close you'll get wet."
597,Amazing 40m Rain Vortex is the worlds tallest indoor waterfall surrounded by lush green is the main attraction at Jewel Changi Airport. At night there are scheduled light and sound show at the Rain Vortex
598,This is the awesome place in airport Changi. I think it is the best concept mall integrated with tbe airport and attraction. You can enjoy the waterfall in the airport mall.
599,"Visited Jewel Changi over the weekend with my kids. Jewel is essentially a massive mall connected the terminals of Changi Airport, and offering travelers a chance to refresh themselves with some retail therapy and a dizzying array of food choices, ranging from A&W to local delights. The highlight of Jewel is obviously the Rain Vortex waterfall. It's quite a spectectular sight.

While we enjoyed strolling around the mall, we find that the queues for restaurants and cafes to be too long, especially at A&W. Singapore has a culture of queueing and I'm not surprised to see such long queues here, especially in such a media-hyped newly opened establishment. Better to have lunch outside before visiting Jewel, else one could starve just waiting for the food.

As for the shopping here, there is very little of anything unique, as most of the shops are the same ones you can find in any other Singapore malls. While it's quite an experience to visit Jewel Changi, I wouldn't recommend this place for serious shoppers. It's more catered towards travelers transiting in Singapore.

Overall, I would say Jewel is worth a visit, but not a place one would visit too regularly."
600,Awesome! Central waterfall against backdrop of the rainforest and the skytrains running feels like we've gone back to Jurassic times! Parking is expensive. Food queues are very long during meal times so best to avoid lunch and dinner crowds. Many restaurants and you will be
601,"The main attractions are the largest indoor waterfall, the rain vortex and the canopy area. Surrounding this zone are many shops and eateries. Enough to keep you entertained for hours, including an imax cinema. "
602,Very huge mall with the concept of a garden and indoor waterfall which can be seen no matter which floor you are at. Watch The HSBC vortex light show if you have the time at night. Worth watching. Lots of restaurants and shops. The rooftop bars offer an alfresco dining
603,"Changi airport is a world leader and this new complex with a rain vortex, rainforest and nature trails, surrounded by multiple levels of shops and restaurants is amazing. The rain vortex is illuminated and there is an hourly light show. A nice break for travellers in between"
604,"Changi Jewel is the latest terminal and the outstanding feature is the vortex waterfall. To really enjoy the sight of the cascading water, one should travel to the top by lift and then descend downwards via the spiral walkway and stairs. Then to the basement to see where the"
605,"In love with Jewel Airport. Lots of variety of shops & food, perfect for all ages. The top floor is very nicely decorated and has good ambience, perfect for a night out. "
606,This is a place you can visit if you have time and waiting for your flight at the Singapore airport.  This is mall and accessible from most of the terminals.  It has very good design and colorful water fall inside mall is main attraction.  There are lot of options for dining and
607,"With the Jewel Changi recently open to public, this is a definite must visit with family and friends. One of their standout attractions would be the indoor waterfall especially their light show in the evening.   This place is also good for shopping and also for foodies who just"
608,I have no other words! What the have created is nothing short of spectacular. The waterfall itself is so beautiful but add the gardens and it’s mind blowing. A must see and easy to access from the airport terminals. 
609,If you got time at Changi airport the Jewel is worth an hour visit. Basically it is a mall with a huge cylindrical waterfall surrounded by an indoor jungle. Lots of bars and restaurants. Prices are way cheaper than downtown Singapore. Rad walking or shuttle from terminal. 
610,"We had checked into our flight and decided to look at Jewel and get something to eat prior to our flight.  Everyone from taxi drivers to waiters had urged us to go to the Jewel so we thought it must be super amazing.  It was a long walk from the terminal and its easy to lose track of time, so be sure to factor that in if you are going prior to a flight.  We were disappointed as we arrived about 745am and nothing was open.  The water wasn't flowing in the waterfall either.  There were lots of people just wandering around what is essentially a massive shopping centre with a really big indoor waterfall in the middle of it, and lots of plants.   At 8:00am the waterfall started to flow and it was pretty cool.  Kids absolutely love it.  There are lots of restaurants and there are some climbing activities on the upper level that looked fun (but were not open).  We had to walk back to Changi and get something to eat at Starbucks as it was the only thing open early in the morning.  A bit disappointing but overall its worth a look and to take some pics."
611,"We didn't looked for this place last year when we go to Singapore. But this year, we arrived at terminal 1 changi then just a step from the outside gate we find this place... So beautiful, amazing how Singapore can make this... We also take lunch at the ground. Good for them who had long transfer waiting at airports."
612,"Jewel at Changi Airport, Singapore, is almost beyond believe. And that is because who could imagine that an airport would actually become a leisure/tourist destination? And yet, that is what's happened. A stunning destination with 280 shops and restaurants and all sorts of cool things to do. Incredible greenery, trails, hi-tech game-play and, of course, the mesmerizing Vortex. The stark disparity between Singapore's Changi Airport and the New York airports is almost embarrassing. Fantastic job, Singapore, add this incredible achievement to the already long list: Singapore Night Safari, Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa and all its attractions, Marina Bay Sands complex, Formula 1 night race ... and so much more."
613,"Bringing the outdoor indoor, with amazing landscape. Great place to spend your time before boarding."
614,Its a mall. with beautiful landscapes - and the fountain is just stunning. There is an indoor bridge that connects you to Jewel from Terminal 2. Convenient indeed if you have time upon arrival / before departure. Be prepared to walk about 20 min .. Loads of food - and if you do want to be careful with your pocket - then explore the food court at the bottom floor.
615,"Once again Singapore brings the outdoors indoors so that you can enjoy nature without the humidity and heat!  And they make it visually stimulating.  Jewel is essentially the newest mall in Singapore, with shops and eateries.  One visit is enough for me, personally."
616,"Was there with my family over the weekend and was amazed with the wonderful views, numerous shopping and restaurants that took us hours to complete."
617,"The Jewel had opened since our last visit to Singapore so we made a point of visiting.  We used the MRT to get there and it is clearly signposted.  The whole area is exceptional - loved the indoor waterfall and gardens area but so much more there as well.  Not all the shops/restaurants are open just yet (more opening soon) but still plenty of choice and fantastic venue which is a credit to Singapore.  Plenty to see and do so either allow extra time when travelling to the airport or plan a separate visit.  Would recommend.  A new ""must do"" in Singapore."
618,The convenience of having such an amazing mall beside the airport is truly astonishing. The architectural is just mind boggling! Who would ever thought to create a falls inside a mall! Just WOW!
619,"Though it all about an artificial waterfall inside the complex, its enough to sit there and keep you entertained for hours. The sound of waterfall actually soothes the mind and gives a feeling of being close to nature. Apart from waterfall, there are few activities but all chargeable and better to be done with kids. But keep an eye during these activities as recently there have been a few accidents in news (especially mirror maze). Overall a good place if you got time to kill and no money to buy stuff at duty free/not interested in shopping related activities."
620,Jewel is definitely one of the must go place in singapore now. Its remarkably beautiful and not to mention its indoor. Its a huge place to go and I must say.. Avoid peak hours and weekends. Alot of people are probably the problem you can foresee in this place.
621,Beautiful iconic best airport experience in the world. At must visit when on stopover in Singapore. Wonderful fountain in an airport.
622,"Coming from Dubai,  the Jewel was a good initiative by the Changi airport for travelers to complete their check-in early and go for some shopping.  Behold... all shopping to be completed before 10pm!! This for me killed the thrill as I had just over an hour to venture inside since my flight was only at 1:45am and I had reached the jewel by 8:45pm after early check-in oblivious to the thought that they could close the jewel so early.  

Anyway, the jewel is a shopping mall suited for both locals for an experience as well as tourists for their last minute shopping and have a quick bite or drink.  The main attraction is of course the waterfall (and the hourly light shows) in the rainforest setting.  I would suggest that a tourist visits the jewel before check-in so that the shopped items could be included within the checked in baggage.  Pokémon shop, changi airport shop, a Japanese Knick knack shop were my highlights.  Most of the experiences within the mall were no in operation due to maintenance.

Would say that this is a must visit for all who visit Singapore."
623,Huge awesome indoor Vortex waterfall with indoor garden and lots of restaurants eateries and shopping store in this Jewel Changi Airport. Worth a visit do not go on weekends very crowded and long q in most of the restaurant go on a weekdays.
624,"A great place to visit if you are in transit or want some time in air-conditioned comfort out of Singapore’s heat!  The waterfall is impressive and I would have liked to see it lit up at night. It is surrounded by greenery which is lovely. There is a canopy walk, trampoline type attraction and a maze, which all have a cost. Other than the waterfall the place is giant mall. We didn’t feel like shopping but there are also very many places to eat and we enjoyed a very nice lunch."
625,Jewel changi airport..Beautiful landscape n environment.  Went there for a movie. Love the seats..theatre..sound system etc.  Wonderful experience. Will.definitely visit again!
626,"Spent almost 5 hours going around here before boarding my flight at the connecting Changi Airport. Loved the strong and continuous WiFi service which was unlike the service at the main airport (slow and unstable). No shortage of places to eat, shops to visit, and attractions to explore here at Jewel. Restrooms are clean too and easily accessible whichever floor you are. Terrific place to kill time when your flight is delayed, and I loved that walking in its multiple levels means I get to exercise too in a safe and airconditioned place. Nice!"
627,"We had to been this place for site view and shopping.
The overall experience of site view of Jewel was fabulous and it has the world largest/tallest indoor waterfall I.e 40meter.
On roof of this place, there are couple activities area for adults and kids.
It has beautiful indoor gardens too.

We enjoyed this place."
628,Make sure you take the time to go to all the levels and get a look at the waterfall from all angles.  Many of the shops still to open and the signage back to the airport is very bad - we had to continually ask how to get back as the signs seem to stop without another one.  However its only just opened so take this away and it will be an incredible spot to spend a few hours whilst waiting for a plane
629,"I visited this mall twice during my visit to Singapore. Once after I landed with my luggage from T2 we went to T1 where the entrance to the Jewel is located. I wouldn't do that next time since with the trolley we cannot go to the higher floors since the trolley were not allowed into the elevators. So for the first trip I only went to the 1st floor of the waterfall. When we departed from Changi, we checked in our luggages then we went to the mall. Which is a better idea. At the top floor you can pay to enter some attractions or spend some time in the restaurants with great view of the garden and the waterfall. It's a beautiful mall. It's a must visit in Singapore now."
630,"and its surrounding garden dome - this is a world spectacle, as usual for Singapore with lessons from other indoor waterfalls learned, but way improved.  The place is much bigger and more impressive than the myriad of pix and clips everyone is posting.  

The food around it and the mall are nice and grand and modern, but it's a mall and very upscale mall food.  That doesn't exactly float my boat, but for a stopover, it is nice.

I was coming from T2 and checked in early to see the Jewel.  I went an hour early, and that was enough (I usually allow 3 hrs to go from West Coast to Changi.)  Walkway is longer than you think but still nice."
631,"The jewel has changed the outlook of Changi.
Since we visited on a holiday, the place was really crowded. The whole place had - shopping, all brands. Food on all floors. It is still not done to full, there was work still going on. We wanted to walk on the bridge, but it was closed for some private function. A good place to shop, eat and loaf around. The waterfalls was too good. You get great food, drinks and ice cream too.
A new engineering, architectural marvel truly of the glass and metal kind. The waterall also keeps the place cool. You have it all indeed!
It is good when viewed in the evening with the jewel all lighted up."
632,"Jewel was amazing, we spent a few hours shopping and exploring before our flight to Bali.  It is an absolute must see if you are in Singapore."
633,"Spacious walkways and plenty of food in Basement levels, as well as restaurants at every level. The sky park area provides a nice watering hole precient. The foodcourt though could do more justice with less seatings to make it more spacious. Aside from the huge stores and plentiful of brands, the cinema and hotel does make this place unique. The indoor waterfall is definitely the attraction to capture everyone's awe."
634,"Firstly living in Singapore, I was sceptical about The Jewel as just another huge shopping mall - joined to the world class airport. 

Dropped off a friend at T1 and decided to wander up to see. Wow, how smart was that arrivals come out after baggage straight into the mall. No leaping straight into a taxi or the MRT but the ritzy shops and buzz sucks you into this maze of retail, food, coffee shops, bars, waterfalls, landscaping and light shows. 

Just go and visit. I'm not a big shopper but had fun just walking around. Allow about 1 hour to wander. 

Nighttime is best."
635,My friend and I had a layover at the airport and the jewel recently opened so we figured we’d check it out. The waterfall is pretty amazing. It was fun to check it out at the different floors. There were shops and different attractions. There were things to do for different ages. It’s worth checking out if you have time. You can either walk around for free or pay for the different attractions.
636,"amazing, climate controlled lush green with sound of water everywhere. Beautiful vistas every turn.  Upper levels for the waterfall, lower levels for the vortex."
637,"I am always proud of Changi airport. Simply  the best airport . Then they just go and made it better with Jewel. Now people will leave for the airport a few hours in advance or just stay another day so they could be at Jewel. Massive mall with lots of good restaurants and food, the fountain the canopy walk . There’s too much to actually pack into 1 day alone."
638,"A giant shopping mall with a beautiful vortex waterfall right smack in the heart of changi airport. A nice place to hang out with family and friends on any given day or before sending them off to their adventures. Filled with a lot of eateries and a cinema will definitely bring crowds in just to spend the day. It gives us more reasons to go to the airport now too, even if we are not travelling out of Singapore."
639,"Location: If you have only a day’s layover in Singapore, you wouldn’t regret visiting the Jewel. It’s just minutes from the different terminals at Changi Airport.

The Jewel boasts of a family-friendly cinema, a huge shopping mall which houses many international Brands from Salvatore Ferragamo to Laderach Chocolatier Suisse to Tokyo Hands to Zara, Hugo Boss, Cath Kidston and many others. 

Dining: It’s a food paradise with countless dining options from Spanish to Japanese to Chinese and Western. Burger and Lobster and Shake Shack are here but I think you might want to wait for the craze to die down before trying to queue up for food. But if you are a foreigner and would like to try out decent Singaporean food at reasonable prices, just head over to the food court at Basement 1. Roast Duck, Indonesian Fare, Satay, Fishball Noodles and Barbecued Chicken wings await you.

Kid-Friendly Entertainment:
The Canopy Park at the TOP floor was great for my 5-7 year olds. Admission fees apply. It’s an air conditioned indoor playground that is similar to our iconic Gardens By the Bay which was featured in the movie Crazy Rich Asian. (Photos as attached)

Of course, not forgetting Instagram-worthy shots of the HSBC vortex. Don’t be surprised if you get too overwhelmed with crowds wanting to take wefies though. The view from the TOP floor might be worth taking a look at.

Word of Caution: visit during the weekdays as you might be swarmed with Singaporeans who are just as excited as you are to visit the Jewel. Easily accessible by train: Changi Airport stop (It takes around 35 min to get to the city)

Disclaimer: I am a Singaporean and I am proud to be one. This place is a must-visit whether you are transiting through Singapore or visiting Singapore. I would rather not jostle with crowds but you shouldn’t miss this out on your itinerary."
640,"We arrived on the early flight from NZ and paid for storage for our suitcases and wanted to see the Jewel which is a must. The waterfall wasn't on when we first arrived so we went and had a coffee. When we came back it was going, it is amazing and nice to just sit and listen to"
641,"The new Jewel changi airport connected from Terminal 1, 2 or 3, it has lots of variety restaurant, shops, and also hotels"
642,I have always enjoyed Changi Airport but the Jewel has made it so much better! A great place with beautiful gardens and lots of shops and restaurants. Great amenities like early check-in and baggage storage. The Jewel makes Singapore an even more attractive destination or
643,If you have at least 2.5 hours spare between flights then you need to head over to The Jewel. Remember that this brand new attraction at Changi Airport is located Land Side which means having to complete the Immigration form and exit the airport (quick and easy). Alternatively
644,"Totally new experience, different airport from all the others one. Nice! Great and totally different views for morning and night. Adults can have fun shopping and kids can enjoy themselves here."
645,"Nice place to visit with a variety of shopping and food choices . Spacious mall with great view. Big and pretty starbucks with special menu that normal Starbucks doesn't have , ideal place for catch up with friends and family"
646,"Visited during Preview. 
Amazing attraction. Spectacular features worth visit for tourists. After visit, can try new eatery from US A&W and Shake Shack. We wanted to try but because of the super llong queue we decided not to. Instead we try out Lev 2 michille star japanese ramen. But it was not worth it in my own opinion."
647,"The Changi Jewel which is linked to Terminal 1 is a must visit place when you are at Changi Airport whether as a transit , disembarking or joining passenger. It is easily accessible from the other passenger terminals.Newly opened it offers shopping arcades, and restaurants including renowned local ones. The man made indoor waterfall acclaimed to be one of the largest indoor in the world offers many scenic views for photographic enthusiasts . There are early checkin counters for major airlines located on level 1 whereby passengers can do an early checkin ( From 24 hours till minus 3 hours before their flight departure) and  given their boarding passes with checked in baggage accepted."
648,A combination of garden & mall concept makes Jewel impressive! Many Malls and greenary all in one place I wish the shops are open till late. The queue at the F&b is  crazy wish the service can be faster. Other than that it is a beautiful place to hangout!
649,Never thought that an airport can be such a integrated leisure n shopping spot in town. No matter the varieties of shops or the international of restaurants. You may also enjoy a movie with the most advance of theater technologies. It's definitely a wonderful recreation place for everyone.
650,"Amazing forest ambiance! Standing in the middle of the huge dome, you can’t feel there is actually a huge concrete mall surrounding you. The forest freshness is ever present, and the waterfall in the centre helps keep the forest illusion “real”; mist, spray, smell and that"
651,The indoor waterfall was truly a sight to behold. The indoor forests was also a very innovative concept. However the queue for chains such as AnW and shake shack was not worth it.
652,"Beautiful, gorgeous, jaw-droppingly awesome, inspired, stupendous, marvelous- I am running out of words to describe the Jewel. I mean see for yourself and you'd understand why!"
653,"Jewel is truly the Jewel in The Crown at Changi Airport. The airport has won multiple awards over the years, including the Best Airport Award. Jewel has a fantastic Rain Vortex, which displays a light show twice a day. There is a wide range of shops from A&W to Shake Shack and"
654,"I think I have been here every week, sometimes twice a week!   Love it!  Thank you Singapore, you always make me proud."
655,We were blown away by how beautiful this place is. It is very easy to access when you are at the airport and is well worth a visit.
656,"There's not a whole lot to see here, other than the indoor fountain, which can be explored around several levels. At the top most level, you can walk around to view the fountain. Worth a visit if you're in the area or have a layover - but not worth going all the way to Changi"
657,On the way back from Singapore to Perth I was told by a couple of people about the Jewel near the T1 terminal I was departing from and the descriptions didn’t do it justice. This incredible engineering mavel boasts the tallest man made waterfall which I have no reason to doubt.
658,"It's easy to dismiss Jewel as another shopping mall in this city of countless malls. Attached to the Changi airport, Jewel first catches your attention by its facade, resembling a cut polished jewel. Inside the central water-fall feature is spectacular. Highest indoor water fall"
659,"Whoever would build a shopping centre in the airport?  Only Singapore!  To those detractors who lament it as ""just another shopping mall"", I say they have missed the point.  Singapore has essentially transformed the ""runaway"" mindset of most airport arrivals to that of"
660,"Its not often you can walk into a Shopping Centre and say ""wow""!! The Jewel at Changi is just that.....a jewel. Shaped like a big donut, it is spread over 6 floors and is located in front of Terminal 1 (although accessible from all other terminals). The mall has an large array of retail shopping outlets, an 11 screen IMAX cinema as well as numerous F&B outlets. It also houses a hotel - but the key attractions are the super impressive Rain Vortex (which is at the center of the Mall) and which is the worlds tallest indoor waterfall, the Canopy Park, Mazes and Bridge (which has glass panel flooring) plus the mall has an indoor garden and more plants & trees in it than any other mall in the world. Yes its busy - but it is connected to Terminal 1 arrivals so there are the every curious tourists, but at the same time feels quite tranquil. Like everything else at Changi Airport, its feel effortless. Definitely worth a visit just to see how malls should look and feel!!"
661,We went to check out the famous indoor waterfall at Jewel as we have 3 hours to spare before our flight home.  It was fascinating watching the man made waterfall surrounded by plants and flowers in the middle of a dome shape building.  There are lots of shops and eateries.  A must to visit if one has spare time before a flight.
662,"As reviewed by other visitors, this is another great mall. However since it is new, you may want to come when it is not crowded maybe on weekdays. We went Saturday night  and all eating place are packed."
663,"People may come here for shopping or food, but for me, my sole purpose to come here are the attraction it offer! The first of many attraction is the biggest indoor waterfall in the world! Its breathtaking! I've been told there are many more attraction to come by 10th june 2019. For muslim visitor who which to find halal food, go to Terminal three (B2 level). There are lots of halal food court and restaurant at that level."
664,"Looking in news, I couldn’t imagine such ! I can only say this is really impressive and great ! Well done SINGAPORE !! Do not miss this place. The mall is nice too walk too
Changi will keep it first place of best airport of the world for another number of years"
665,"This is the new attraction in Singapore.  A large enclosed dome with waterfall, gardens, eateries, shopping, ... all in one.  You can spend a couple of hours in a comfortable cool location with many rest areas.  It will be much better if we have outdoor equipment shops, camera/electronic shops and Apple shop there!"
666,"We had been to jewel changi for shopping and dining. Dishes at tapas club, a spanish restaurant are delicious. Pizza maru, for cheese lovers is a must try. Queue at shakeshack made us disheartened. Breakfast at cafe morozoff very tasty. Footwear at nike or fila is little expensive. Overall you can have all singapore shopping at one."
667,"Went to Changi early before our flight home to see the famous attraction and was disappointed,most of the attractions were not going to be open until June 10:so all we basically saw was the spectacular waterfall and another mass shopping mall, To pass away the time went to the movies at the centre,which cost us $4 each."
668,"When visiting Jewel remember it is a shopping centre. There are many of the same shops one can visit in Singapore city. The environment is interesting as it brings gardens into the centre with different spots to sit and relax between shopping and the food areas are plentiful. The one big ticket item is the water cascade, you can’t miss that and you can walk from the bottom level to the top via a viewing trail either by stairs or you could just catch a lift.Overall an interesting concept for a shopping mall in an airport. The one downside, it makes the airport itself look tired, dated  and under serviced especially in the transit areas."
669,"A must-visit once you touch down Singapore Changi Airport. Jewel Shopping Mall is connected to Terminal 1 and it is easily accessible by a link bridge from Terminal 2 & 3. 

The first thing to view is the Rain Vortex. It's a huge indoor water fountain that is about 5 stories tall. The water falls inwards. It has laser light show nightly. Surround the vortex is the Sheshido Forest Valley - an indoor mini forest with trees, plants, flowers and bushes. At night, the forest will be lighted up beautifully, with soothing surround music. You will see many people sitting round the forest, relaxing and listening to the fountain fall,  and enjoying the view of vortex. A great place for picture taking too.

After mid-June, you can try out the canopy walk and giant slide at the roof top. The kids will love it. However, remember to wear pants coz you don't want people at below level to see the colour of your undies! Oh ya, it is chargeable. Check out the price before entry.

There are many eateries in the mall, ranging from Chinese cuisines, Western delight, cafes, fast food, bakeries, snack bars, ice cream parlour to hawker food etc. You will be spoilt for choice.

Shopping wise, you can have top brands to local brands for fashion, nothing much special.

After touring Jewel, you can easily catch a MRT (subway or train) to your destination/hotel."
670,"Its located outside changi airport so you have to exit the airport to get there and it was nice and huge with lots of great food to try. 

Nice vortex waterfall and got lots of shops but love the selection of foods variety over there. 
You can find famous foods from all over the world from shake shack, kams, burger n lobster and etc etc. 

Just love the place at jewel. 
If you got long layover in singapore its a place to kill time."
671,"😋 😋 😋! 
Love it 🥰
So fishy fishball and soft . 
Dry noodle was mixed just nice 👍 with the right amount of sauce, very balance with the noodle."
672,"I spent close to 4 hours at the Changi International Airport at Singapore.
It was very less time to discover , what this wonderful Airport has to offer.
So idecided to skip the shopping malls and head straight for witnessing the JEWEL.

In simple terms it is the name give to the Architectural Marvel at the Terminal 1 of SIngapore airport.
It is also connected internally by a skybridge as well as a skytrain with terminal 3 of the airport.
The centrespot of attraction is the huge waterfall inside the airport.
I am not sure about the stats but i believe it is a 100 meter waterfall.
So you must see this from atleast floor number 4 and go down to the basement level B4 to see two absolutely different perspective of this waterfall.
Its simply awesome."
673,"Just went to Jewel, the view of the waterfall is excellent and the food there is delicious👍. There are many attractions there such as the canopy park, mirror maze and the bouncing net."
674,"If you are passing through Changi Airport, you must check-out ""Jewel"".  It just opened a couple months ago, and I can already see more green (vegetation) since the opening.  From inside the immigration area, if you take the skytrain between Terminals 2 and 3 - the train goes right through Jewel giving you a different view of the waterfall."
675,"After 5 hours exploring the Jewel, it felt like the Marina Bay Sands inside the Domes of Gardens by the Bay. I like the greenery and the large waterfall including being able to dine beside it. 

It generated lots of jobs to manage crowds and serve the food and shops. Service has been good. 

It’s crowded. If you don’t go to A&W and Shake Shack, you get to enjoy a lovely dining experience with the vast options available at affordable prices. 

It’s a feast for the eyes everywhere you go. A sensory overdrive and you will never get bored for hours. 

There is a lovely Fairprice Finess supermarket so well stocked. 

Don’t bother visiting the food court, it’s stuffy and dark. Not nice to eat there. The restaurants are much better with fountain view and cost a bit more but you will get a unique experience dining at the Jewel. 

I like that many of the shops offer free food sampling. 

My favorite restaurant is Maison de PB."
676,"Amazing place which operates like a large mall with ample of food selections (basement food court esp.) and big area to move around.

You just need to come to airport early for you departure flight so make this as your last destination before leaving.

When you thought the toilets in Singapore airport couldn't get better, this place just surpasses that expectation.

One of the main worries about crowded place is the toilet, or rather the lack of it, and it's cleanliness. But there is a toilet (with ample rooms) everywhere and it is so clean despite the crowd."
677,"Jewel Shopping Mall is located right opposite Changi Airport Terminal 1's Arrival Hall on the land side. Its claim to fame is the world's largest indoor waterfall, with multimedia shows centred on the cascading water held every night at hourly intervals ftom 7.30pm through 13.30am.

There are plenty of airside attractions within the airside areas of Changi Airport's four terminals catering to transit travellers. However, transit travellers using Changi Terminal 1 with a layover of at least 3.5 hours may wish to check out the huge waterfall right in the middle of Jewel Mall i.e. 2.5 hours for a pitstop and returning to the Airport airside about 45 minutes to an hour before the outbound flight ETD.  

Besides viewing the indoor waterfall, travellers may pick up some Made in Singapore products and food gifts, and perhaps grab a quick bite or some refreshments before the next flight. Changi Airport souvenirs and the world's first Pokemon Concept Store outside Japan are on Level 4 of Jewel Mall, while Level 1 hosts many of the Singapore food gift shops, i.e. bbq pork jerky (from 'Bee Cheng Hiang'), pre mixed spices and seasoning for popular local dishes like chicken rice, chilli crab etc. (from 'Taste Singapore'), local swiss rolls with coconut jam (from 'Rich & Good Cake Shop') and artisanal cookies with tropical herbs and other ingredients (from 'Cookie Museum'), etc.

Travellers leaving Singapore on red eye flights out of Terminal 1 may take a taxi to Jewel instead of the terminal building, for early check in on Level 1, followed by dinner at one of the mind boggling variety of F&B outlets spread across B1, B2 and Levels 1 through 5. Private hire vehicles may drop off passengers on Level 2; travellers should use the downward escalator near 'Shake Shack' fast food restaurant to reach the early bird check in counters on Level 1.

Travellers using the other Terminals 2,3,4 who wish to visit Jewel should may use sheltered, overhead link bridges. Personally I won't bother to detour to Jewel as there are enough shops and facilities in the airside areas to keep anyone occupied till ETD."
678,A great water fall show with all the planting hard to know you are in the middle of an airport. Surrounded by shops making it a very busy place with a lot of people if you want a quiet place to chill out this is not the place. plenty of eating options just could not find any gluten free options.
679,Never would I have believed an Airport would become a destination in and of itself.  The beauty and music are an amazing combination and time worth spent!
680,"I’m so stunned on how they manage to build a large forest indoor. It looks like they build everything for the trees to grow. Supply soil for it to root, water and food to fill its body, UV for it to photosynthesize, temperature control. The waterfall is so impressive.  The light"
681,"We originally planned to fly in from Kota Kinabalu and stay in a Singapore city hotel. Then we saw the info on the Jewel and the Yotelair hotel.  So, to the Jewel..... We arrived around 6pm, booked into the hotel and then went for a quick walkabout on the top floor around the"
682,"In spite of all the hype, Jewel Changi is just a massive shopping mall near a big international airport. Shops, shops and shops - and most of them the same brands and chains you can find anywhere in the world. What makes it different is the giant spectacular water feature and"
683,"We visited late afternoon/evening on a Sunday - so given it was a weekend and the Jewel has only been open for 3 weeks, the enormous crowds of people were perhaps not surprising! Nevertheless, the water vortex was fascinating, especially after dark with the added music and multi"
684,"In a chaotic mall, suddenly there’s an area with a superb vortex waterfall and a green surroundings. Good place for a break after few hours of shopping. It’s simply awesome."
685,"The waterfall trully impressive, but nothing else to see. The rest just a typical mall.  Ps. They have a pokemon store which not every country have it. If you're a pokemon maniac, it's a must "
686,A must see.  I'd happily spend all day there.  Nice bars and cafe on the top floor.  I'll go back with the DSLR and the family.
687,"Very good place to visit if you have time flying out of the airport or arrival with great chance to take photos , great for locals also to visit   Very well planned as expected in Singapore , good place to visit and spend extra hours before check in as hotel checkout is 1200 pm"
688,"The jewel is huge, full of shop, restaurants and sights to see. The only trouble is that half of Singapore comes to enjoy the “resort” that is situated in the middle of Changi airport- which means if you are a traveler so path is blocked by dawdling families, screaming kids,"
689,"Went to visit Jewel Changi for first time. New and latest attraction in SINGAPORE. Many tourist, travellers and local visitors. The main focus is the rain fountain in the centre of the building. Must see. "
690,The water feature is overwhelming- never saw anything like it. It's like something you would expect at Disney and Epcot (if they kept it up). The mall itself is too crowded with too many people taking selfies.
691,"Brilliant display of lights dancing within a 40m swirling vortex, in a centre of a 5-storey high garden with 2,500 trees and 100,000 shrubs, complete with monorail moving in the background and Hollywood blockbuster soundtrack. 

Be sure to catch this Rain Vortex show daily at 830pm, 930pm. Admission is FREE.

Jewel feels like a grand showcase of Singapore's ""City in a Garden""  vision."
692,"Was early at Terminal 2 waiting to pick up family members on an inbound flight and decided to see what all the hype of The Jewel was about.

Ok, essentially it is a mall with F&B outlets and entertainment opportunities like the Canopy Walk and Changi Experience.

The center piece was of course the indoor waterfall. Now, that was impressive. We were lucky to be there just when the light show started. Quite a sight.

By the way, the Jewel is located next to T1 and is connected to the other Terminals via a walkway.

Overall a decent enough place"
693,"with only one and half hour to spare prior to boarding, one can easily take a visit to this intriguing feature of changi. 5 mins to reach the waiting area after checking in our luggage. 3 minutes for the bus to arrive. 7 minutes to get to the drop off point and another 15 minutes to walk to the mall the center of which can be found the JEWEL of changi. from afar, it looks like a spaceship taking off. but upon approach, one can see why it is titled as such. the man-made waterfall was a big hit you cannot even take a selfie without a photobomber in the shot. you need to patiently position yourself to get the right angle to capture its magnificence.

i wonder how it looks like at night. i can only imagine the vivid colors those lights make when they collide with water. i wish we could stay longer."
694,"Feels like walking in the park, with a waterfall... actually you are inside a mall and connected to one of the busiest airport in the world, Singapore Changi airport.

Relax and unwind from your journey, either before or after or in between..."
695,"We had heard that the tallest indoor waterfall had opened at the Singapore Airport in April, but didn't think too much about it. We came through Singapore a second time on our five-week Asia vacation, and stayed at the Changi Crowne Plaza Hotel. The Jewel happens to be right next door to this hotel, so we walked over to this mega mall for dinner.

Wow--we had no idea! The waterfall was amazing and beautiful with the evening light show.  It's one of those travel experiences that could go either way (really good or really bad).  

It was fun to see locals visiting this new attraction for the first time. They were interspersed with airline travelers pulling their suitcases, who had extra time between connecting flights. It was Friday evening, so quite crowded (although we're used to that being from California).

The mall itself is great.  Very wide and spacious walkways and a large selection of restaurants.  We had a great pizza at the Pizza Express (and also terrific desserts).  

This experience was worth going out of our way for.  Apparently, the fifth floor will have various attractions, but it was closed when we were there."
696,This was the first attraction & impression of Singapore to us. We thought of spending 30 minutes however ended up spending 90 minutes there as the kids enjoyed viewing the waterfall and forest near waterfall. The aroma was pleasing and soothing. Worth a visit.
697,"I can safely say it is One of the best Garden Airport in the world. The indoor waterfall with its beautiful lasers depicting colourful lights display especially in the night is really awesome. There are also a large variety of food and beverage outlets for all young and old folks to choose for your tastebuds. There are 5 floors of everything branded shops etc and food, snacks like delicious burgers, fusion ice cream etc etc. The balancing Canopy Park at the top floor will be another eye openers for the young and middle age and the garden on top with beautiful flowers and plants on display are a sight to take in. 
A must visit on the way to airport to leave the country (allow extra 2 hours for your tour) Or upon your arrival. 
It will be best to make the Changi Jewel as an extra itinerary to take in the beautiful sights and shop and dine at the same time. Have fun & enjoy!!"
698,"The Changi Jewel is breathtaking. The centerpiece attraction commands the notice of the passengers and most eateries are located within view of the waterfall, making for very serene dining. The mall is also elegantly designed with very wide corridors and well-cleaned toilets. Must visit."
699,This place was something straight of an avatar movie. So much to look at. It really is a marvel and a must see.
700,"Now Changi Airport has a shopping mall with an awesome waterfall display.
Fantastic idea for those with a long stop over."
701,"If you are going to Singapore Changi Airport, you should visit the wonderful CROWN JEWEL OF Changi Airport. It’s was really wonderful experience."
702,"The vortex and greenery does remind one of Gardens by the Bay and it is truly hypnotic looking at the water cascading down at the various vantage points. This will be the next viral photo after MBS surboard rooftop. The variety of stores and duplex concepts do make your heart skip a beat but unlike MBS, the price range is a lot more accessible. I like the fact that local brands are showcased in this mall like Naise, Supermama, Rich and Good, Lim Chee Guan. There are so many eateries that you will be spoilt for choice. I also like the ample toilets/lifts/escalators that are easily accessible and not tucked in 1 corner to maximise retail leasing real estate."
703,"Changi Airport is the best airport in the world, and so Jewel Changi is the best shopping mall in Singapore.  The indoor waterfall is definitely a spectacle, together with the vegetation inside the mall - simply an oasis.  The building was very thoughtfully designed that allows sunlight to light up the mall and reduces its electricity consumption.  There are also many famous shops and restaurants here - lots to try and lots to do!"
704,"Jewel Changi Airport is a real jewel. A real gem in that sense. I was there for the pre-opening and was taken aback by its beauty and lush greenery. The indoor waterfall, Vortex is the main highlight of the Jewel. Beautiful! Aside from that, there are many shops and eateries. Must visit!"
705,"It’s a great place for all ages. I like the fact that most of it are our local shops. There’s movie theatre, loads of different entertainment for all ages. I went there during the preview and it was not as crowded as I thought it will be. Spacious. Though I miss my A&W, the queue doesnt worth my effort. Probably will head back the mall after 6-12 months when it’s less crowded. My two cents: perhaps there will be more free seating area added? It is a fantastic place for seniors to go to and hence it will be good there’s more seats for them to rest their legs after walking."
706,"The whole area is so spacious, combining leisure, nature, shopping, dining, entertainment activities all under 1 roof. The cannot miss - HSBC Rain Vortex. Jewel Changi Airport, it's not only a place for the tourists, but also for locals. Travelling in between terminals is a breeze..I love the place."
707,"This is one of the most amazing shopping centres I have ever seen. It is absolutely spectacular - you could spend hours walking around & still not see everything.
There seems to be an endless number of restaurants & shops, with a constant stream of people walking around enjoying the atmosphere.
The centre attraction is the rain vortex - simply stunning - the designer / architect  who came up with the concept to the engineers who brought it to life have to be extremely proud of this achievement.

Definitely worth a visit, and plan to spend at least a couple of hours there."
708,"This place was picturesque. Definitely take in the waterfall as it will leave you wanting to look at it for hours. I could have easily stayed there with a book for the day. It doesn't feel like an airport when you are there, it feels more like a mall. They've set it up in so residents of Singapore can visit anytime - flight or no flight. It is a great attraction and would recommend it to a friend."
709,"Either just to catch a flight, meeting a friend before taking off or just a transit stop, Jewel just added a great reason to be there early! So that you’ll have more time for dinner, shopping and leisurely enjoying the ambiance! It’s setting new standard for an airport environment! Convergence of tropical garden /Vortex with dinning/shopping while waiting for flight Or time to pass!"
710,"Just recently inaugurated the latest attraction of Singapore Airport - JEWEL of Changi. The sunday morning, thousand of visitor crowded at Jewel, the international travellers as well as the locals, visited the spectacular attraction of highest water fall at Singapore. So many visitors queeing up orderly thru the 5 levels of staircase and travelators. And, so many eateries and restaurants catering the visitors. Its a holiday sunday, young families as well as the
olders spectators coming to the vanue. No wonder that Singapore is famous for sophisticated high tech attraction. Beside 4 international terminals, now Jewel is included as the new destination for the travellers as well as the general public in Singapore."
711,"A huge shopping centre with numerous restaurants. Crowded with locals and tourists. Snaking queue for Shake Shack. The main attraction, HSBC Vortex is lovely, good for photos but was crowded most of the time. Good for passengers to pass some time while waiting for their flights."
712,"Let's start with the good:

1. Amazing mall and amenities.
2. Easy access to the airport
3. Good restaurants
4. Early check-in for select airlines (CHECK BEFORE GOING)

And the bad (why it is only getting 3 stars):
1. Scraping the barrel with brands. When Shake Shack has the pole position in a brand new $1.7b mall and is rubbing shoulders on that same level with Tokyu Hands and Muji, makes me worry...
2. Drop off has NO ACCESS TO EARLY CHECK IN!!! Beware. If you are thinking that this is a HK IFC style set-up, you will be sadly mistaken. The Jewel drop off is located a level above the early check-in, there are NO CARTS provided and the carts (even if there were any) are not allowed in the mall to go down to the early check-in. Horrible design and just a shame since they were so close to getting it right... How are you supposed to use the early check in if you can't even get to it???
3. Hotel: The Yotel is a joke. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! It is very hard to get to (up on L4), the rooms are no larger than a closet and if you have bags with you, as point 2 states, you can't get a baggage cart to take them to the hotel with you...

Other than that, thought it was an amazing place!"
713,"One can’t help admire the shopping mall of the future! 

Great place to see, shop if you have deep pockets, & relax in their garden with luscious greenery & the HSBC Rain Vortex right in the center of the Jewel.

Plan to visit Jewel on your free day, I don’t think you can get all things (eat, drink, shop, & look around) done in 4 hours. The Jewel is quite a distance from Terminals 1, 2, 3, or 4; you must have a layover or not less than 10 hours to enjoy Jewel."
714,It has just opened. You have to add to your list of places to visit while in Singapore. Please leave plenty of time to spend there or you just might miss your flight.....
715,"This mall is situated at Singapore Changi Airport area. It is easily accessible via public transport, and is connected via walkway to 3 of the airport terminals. You could also at the skytrain from terminal 2 or 3 to go there. There is a garden with an indoor waterfall in the"
716,Gorgeous Manmade wonder on earth. A veritable rainforest which comes alive in the evening with the beautiful colors.
717,"If you arrive early to the airport, check in at the counter and then walk to the Jewel Mall before you go through security. This new futuristic looking shopping center has in its centerpiece the world’s largest indoor funneled waterfalls surrounded in a park like setting. The"
718,"So beautiful! At night there are displays at the world's largest indoor waterfall. There is a supermarket, cinema, variety dining choices, including shopping! Easily connected to terminals 1-3 and mrt station (t1), you definitely need to come here when you are in Singapore!"
719,"There were a lot of buzz about the latest Jewel in town (well, Singapore is a tiny country after all).  I got myself 15 mins spare before departing to walk around this fountain and see why .. it’s a beautiful architecture and well worth the walk.. all the greens and sound of the"
720,"Passed by today, just there for a transit. The jewel mall attached with airport terminal can easily access via sky bridge. 

There are waterfall show once in every hour."
721,"Met up a friend at the Jewel Changi Airport, and I was totally impressed with the futuristic architectural design as well as the spaciousness, and great varieties of shops and dining choices. 

We have the World’s Tallest Indoor Waterfall with a nightly light and sound show being projected on the sheet of the plunging water. 

A canopy park will be slated for opening in June. There are a number of roof TOP restaurants.

Don’t forget to try the durian pudding from the 717 Trading shop, which specialises in offering durian made pastries. 

This is definitely a great space for you to spend time if you have a long connection time for some retail therapy, or have a great meal with a wide array of options - American burgers, Spanish tapas, sandwiches, Chinese dumplings or almost anything you could think of.

Big retail stores of Nike, Fila, Adidas, as well as the high end boutiques are found in this five storey building. 

It is great to meet a Friend for a cup of tea/coffee if you live in the East Coast of Singapore. 

Nearest MRT - Changi Airport. You could walk to Jewel from Terminal 1,2 or 3 through the link bridge."
722,"Wow!! What a place, excellent location for the Jewel shopping mall to be located, just a stone throw away from changi terminal 1.
The place is really, really exciting, interesting, environmental friendly, the center of the building has a huge waterfall, fully AC, lots of shopping areas, huge sighting seeing setting.
Highly recommended if one is around changi or in Singapore"
723,"Wow, this place is totally surreal. A giant circular multi-level shopping mall with a garden and a stunning waterfall in the middle. It was very crowded when we were in, but I guess it's as expected considering it was a weekend and this place has had just opened."
724,"The Jewel is not just another shopping mall, it is the most outstanding and beautiful experience for a property that is essentially a retail offering. You will find it hard not to imagine yourself in a forest in many of the locations around the building. No attempt to maximise the retail area, this mall gives substance to design and space.The waterfall which descends from the glass domed roof is spectacular. It  opened in late April and has quickly become the go to shopping and eating experience. Many airline passengers arrive early with early checkin counters for most or all the airlines at The Jewel. It is a great place to visit before your flight. There are so many restaurants to choose from and the design of most is so creative. Excellent addition to the Singapore shopping experience."
725,This is what going to an airport should be. Vortex waterfall is amazing. The mrt transport to the airport is first class. Singapore is a wonderful place to visit. 
726,A MUST VISIT. Simply another world class production of Spore. The main feature is obviously the indoor vortex waterfall which is HUGE and sits in the centre. My favourite thing about this place is having so much of eateries in one place. Don’t have to travel all over Spore to
727,The airport itself is very well done and instructions are easy to follow. We had a short time to our flight and decided to walk all the way from a different terminal to see the Jewel (waterfalls). a 15 minute walk from Terminal 2 was worth it.   Huge man made falls in a circular
728,"Jewel is a huge mall , well-connected with all the terminals. As of now its quite crowded as everyone is heading there. It's an amazing place with many eateries and shops to spend money :-)  Every possible cuisine is available there."
729,"This newly opened mall is directly connected to Changi airport terminal one (also accessible to terminal two and three).   The mall has so many food and retail outlets that you will be spoilt for choice.  Regardless if you are local and foreigner, it is a great place to spend"
730,"Do what we did...make time to visit before your flight. Yes of course there are the usual shops you can find anywhere, but the gardens, the building, the waterfall will simply take your breath away.
And you can still find a quiet corner to relax."
731,"As I wrote more than once, I see something new, notable to spectacular, every year I visit Singapore. This time it is stunning: the sparkling Jewel standing tall right in the heart of Changi, the efficient and beautifully landscaped Airport of Singapore.

The brand new destination connected to the terminals is garden, forest, waterfall, shops, shopping mall, restaurants, viewing galleries and playground all rolled into one giant gem. All over the vast place, one cannot help but marvel at the natural freshness of woodland. What is lacking is the filth, dust, weeds and rotting vegetation. Well over 280 shopping and dining areas and even a hotel are tucked in around the area spread over in multiple levels.

The focal point is the huge central dome, standing in the middle of the entire edifice. Jewel is justifiably proud of the the grandeur of the 40 meters-high HSBC Rain Vortex, and accurately claims it as the world's tallest indoor waterfall. This gush of water does not duplicate a natural waterfall. It is a huge circular torrential outpouring from the tall roof. It is water dropping down in the upper floors, but transform into a slide along the huge circular, transparent wall. Sound of elemental waterfall thunders down in the atmosphere from soundtrack. We visited the Jewel in the evening. As night falls, I believe, the waterfall acquires multihued splendor.

It is possible to go to Jewel after checking in from one of the terminals. But remember, one is leaving the security-and-immigration-cleared area, and therefore, go through the going-out and re-entering formalities. Luggage and wheeled bags are taboo. Conveniently, they can be safely entrusted to the baggage store.

Entry to Jewel is free now. One needs not be travelling through Changi Airport to enter. Anyone can walk into Jewel. In fact, I would suggest that unless you have a several-hours layover between flights, you would do better by not combining travel and the Jewel visit. Jewel demands and deserves several hours of unhurried, relaxed roaming.

Jewel has not completed installing all the attractions, though the areas now open do not have any stigma of unfinished work. The fifth floor Canopy Park with its manicured gardens and several play attractions will open by the middle of June.

It is already announced that the Canopy Bridge with a glass bottom, suspended 23 meters above the ground, and with fog emitting at both ends creating the illusion of waking on the clouds, will be added in June."
732,"Jewel is Changi Airport’s newest addition and it has that wow factor that leaves you speechless — while also ensuring that Singapore Airport keeps its “world’s best” title. 

The Jewel’s centerpiece and star attraction is the Rain Vortex, which appears to fall from the sky in the middle of The shopping mall. The world's tallest indoor waterfall, the Rain Vortex can be heard before it is seen but when you do suddenly come across it cascading from 40m, it is a dramatic sight that you can’t stop Instagramming! 

It is surrounded by lush gardens of thousands of trees and flowers and features a lovely meditation space at the bottom. 

The rest of the shopping mall — that happens to link the various terminals, is full of fantastic stores, quirky boutiques as well as luxury brands, and all sorts of foodie delights that range from fast food to haute cuisine. 

We spent a good three hours there before our flight and could easily have stayed longer. It is massive but well signposted and there are shuttles to take you to and from your terminal. 

An absolute must!"
733,"The Jewel is essentially a quality mall attached to Changi airport.   There is a good range of shops and restaurants plus the excellent attraction of a waterfall and vertical garden in the core.   It appears that more attractions and activities will be added.   There is an early checkin desk.   We checked in early in Terminal 3 and then spent about 2 hours exploring The Jewel.   I wouldn’t do that again but if you have spare time at the airport, it’s a nice place to spend it."
734,"Before our flight we decided to see the Jewel. The waterfall is nice, the rest is just a mall full of Singaporean’s standing in line for food. Not a place for travellers. It’s just another mall..."
735,An excellent new place to visit for everyone....regardless you are a local or a tourist! Lots of shops and restaurants that you would probably need hours to see them all. The highlights are Shiseido Forest Valley & The HSBS Rain Vortex. We visited the Forest Valley and Rain Vortex in the daylight hours and evening hours. You will be mesmerised like we did!
736,Jewel shopping centre had only been open a few days when l visited. It is possible to check your bags in at the shopping centre.  There were more locals than travelers. The fountain in the center was spectacular. Great shopping! Sue Savage
737,"Checked our luggage in then meandered across to Jewel, wow what an impressive mall, stunning features on the ceiling like jewelled bows & the waterfall vortex is captivating & very soothing it  changes colours too, surrounded by lots of plants especially sunflowers & orchids.

There are lots of designer shops & places to eat, having so much to do, you could easily lose track of your flight!"
738,"We visited on our departure from Singapore.  Left our hotel about 90 mins earlier than we needed to and took the MRT to the airport.  Followed the signs for Jewel (you take the bridge walk but I guess you could easily take the Skytrain and get off at Terminal One and walk from there).  Found the Early Check-in counters on Level one, checked in for our flight and dumped our suitcase.  Then we went for a walk around to see the waterfall thing.  It is very impressive, take the escalator to a higher level and look at it from above too or walk up the paths and steps from level one.  The plants etc will surely be more impressive after a few months of growth (things grow so quickly in Singapore, it won't take long!) but it is going to be a bit like the Rainforest dome at Gardens by the Bay only with a very impressive waterfall.
The shops etc are really just like any other shopping centre in the City."
739,"Recently opened at Changi Airport Singapore, this 10-storeyJewel has the tallest indoor waterfall towering at 40m, and surrounded by 'rainforest giving the Jurassic feel'. Very pretty at night with a light and sound show.

There are lots of shops and F&B outlets, plus a cineplex.

The top floor holds the 'activity discovery area' such as a maze, a bouncing and walking net, a slide and a mist and topiary garden which will be ready in June."
740,"Awesome place to have a nice meal at, do have dinner because then you can check out the light show at night!   Daily Timings are:  730pm 830pm 930pm 1030pm 1130pm 1230am"
741,"This is another architecture marvel designed by the same genius, Moshe Sadfie, who designed the famous Singapore icon - Marina Bay Sands.   This was originally the Changi Airport and now being renovated. The building includes dining, shopping, adventure park, ATMs for cash"
742,"The main attraction is the biggest indoor water fall. Lots of shops and restaurants. Unfortunately, the canopy walk on the 5th floor is closed until June. Anyway, there are restaurant and  bars still open on the 5th floor i. e.  Privé."
743,"Beautiful design and breathtaking indoor waterfall. The Jewel is linked to Terminal 1 to 3, consists of F&B restaurants and retail outlets.The place  is worth visiting."
744,Absolutely awesome to find a Gem in an Airport!  So much to see and experience.  Great architecture in modern perspective.
745,"You never be bored in Changi Airport, there are lots of beautiful scenery you can get. Especially the indoor waterfall was really amazing!"
746,Visually stunning a 40m indoor waterfall. 5 tiers of vegetation wirh paths up. Surrounded by 5 floors of shops.
747,It is so spacious and huge as it is connected to all the four terminals. I was attracted to the huge hologram fountain. Very well done indeed plus it is the main attraction too. My niece and nephew were so excited to see it. Anyway it was extremely crowded but we will definitely
748,Worst place to park. $5 an hour is ridiculous. Overrated as the shops are all the same throughout the whole island. Can give this a miss.
749,A must visit place even if you are just in transit in Singapore Changi airport. There are world renowned restaurants and it is a world class shopping mall.  You must go to experience it to understand the wow factor. Jewel is next to Terminal 1 and is linked to all 4 terminals.
750,"I am a local, I visited Jewels during the preview. It was super crowded and we did'nt get to see much due to the crowd. And the restaurant are packed too especially Shake Shack, their maiden store in SEA and also A&W making a come back after so many years. My 2nd visit I book YotelAIR to stayed for a night, that's when me and my wife really have all my time for Jewel...endless praises for the design, cleanliness and so many more. Definitely will be the favourite hangout for many..There's no airport like JEWEL CHANGI"
751,"Awesome place to spend some time while waiting for your flight.
The garden is huge and the waterfall makes you speechless.
It's a 5 minute walk from the airport, in a covered passway, entrance is free.
There's a big mall around it also, with many stores."
752,"Not all attractions are ready yet in the Jewel. But the landscape and waterfall itself are simply amazing. With the skytrain passing by, it just feels like in the future. It is really big mall, should reserve more time to explore the Jewel before your departure flight."
753,"The first thing you will see right at the entrance (Level 2) of Jewel Changi is the spectacular towering rain vortex. It huge and for the fact that its put right in the middle of an airport is amazing. The entire Jewel Changi consist of F&B, retail stores that are super spacious and also a hotel build for the convenience of customers who are transiting an have no place to stay. Overall the design are modern yet gives a cosy vibe."
754,A stunning 40m indoor waterfall surrounded by vegetation from around the world.  You can dine amidst the beautiful scenery and enjoy the experience as if you are part of the nature.  Great architecture!
755,"We had about a 9 hour transit at Changi Airport so decided to visit the newly opened Jewel. After a long queue at immigration and a rather long walk, we reached the Jewel. The rain vortex is indeed unique and impressive but that was the only wow factor for me. Otherwise just like any shopping centre."
756,I am kidding of course. Very cool and impressive ambience with plenty of choices for food. NTUC Fair price is there too.
757,Great experience! Truly the best. Airport and tourist spot in one... Singapore has never stop evolving in providing its tourist and locals an experience that you will cherish
758,"There is a little confusion between information staff at the airport,  One member of staff said I wouldn’t need to go through immigration to visit the Jewel on my stop over in Singapore.  However that was false, to visit the jewel you have to pass through immigration and get passport stamped.
I had 5 hours in the Jewel,  some great shops, and restaurants, and actually quite peaceful and calming with all the greenery and waterfall.
Overall a great way to pass a few hours between flights."
759,"State of the art design and infrastructure. Indoor Waterfall was majestic and the lights of the artificial forest at night was ambient and calming. Delighted with lots of exquisite shops inside, not to mention the biggest Starbucks in the world."
760,"This new jewel at the airport is definitely a must visit place, especially to see the indoor waterfall and plants, also includes a shopping mall, food court, etc"
761,"Incredible.
The waterfall is an incredible engineering feet.
It is the centre attraction surrounded by trees surrounded by a shopping complex attached to an airport.
A must see in Singapore for me probably the highlight.
There are many levels, you can even go to the underside and touch the plastic that has the water running down it.
Went both day and night. At night i caught the light show which went for a few minutes."
762,"What an amazing airport - no wonder it wins awards ! But it’s SO crowded - wow !!
People everywhere as it’s such a transit club !
We loved  visiting before our flight departed and taking in the sights"
763,Very good layout and really spacious and beautiful. The main attraction which is the areas around the fountain is truly beautiful and looks like it is actually outdoors. Was also pleasantly surprised to discover the lovely Canopy Park right at the highest floor. It is a very well-designed area very good for both adults and children to stroll through. Also a relaxing area to sit and read surrounded by lots of greenery. Really feels like a real outdoor park where kids can run around and play gleefully. Jewel is an amazing place where we can spend many hours enjoying its beauty as well as having all our meals there from breakfast to dinner! A must experience not to be missed.
764,"One of the biggest $1.3billion glass dome mall with 10 levels of 300 retail shops! Attractions are plentiful including famous biggest indoor waterfall Rain vortex, Foggy bowls (like staying in cloud mist - see last picture). Forest valley which is 5 storey - Rainwater is collected and sent down the waterfall, then used to water the gardens around it. At night, the waterfall turned into the backdrop for a gorgeous light show, about 2,500 trees and 100,000 shrubs from countries including Brazil, Australia, Thailand and the US.  Canopy park with canopy mazes and slides which is at top floor. Eateries here include London’s famous Burger and Lobster, Tanuki Raw, and Singapore’s first Tiger Beer “global concept store”.Asia only 2 Pokemon centres, one in Japan and one in Jewel is an instant hit!

It was indeed a fabulous place to go which I managed to get preview tickets before official opening which was 17 April 2019. Jewel is connected to the Arrival Hall (level 1) of Terminal 1."
765,"In spite of the massive holiday crowd, the awesome architecture, cascading greenery & falls cast an inspirational spell on all.  If you have time to spare during your transit, do come and be enchanted by the Jewel."
766,"The jewel opened a few weeks ago. We decided to go to the airport earlier before taking our international flight to checkout the Jewel. Wow what a jewel. It is absolutely stunning! Unfortunately the time we went was on a public holiday, it was just to busy. I think the whole of"
767,Was there last night on the eve of May day holiday.  Quite crowded as drove of people congregated there to catch a glimpse of the place.  Walked around but busy around 10pm most shops are either closed or in the process of closing..... 
768,First time visited Jewel. It's very amazing. Worth to go during your transit or spend you time before your flight to enjoy this breathtaking waterfall. 
769,"I'm penning this review not so much for fellow Singaporeans, as I feel after the hype dies down, Jewel will soon turn into just another mega shopping mall. But Jewel is essential for Changi Airport to raise claim as a regional transport hub, particularly for those transiting via"
770,"This place is incredible. Not as busy as I expected, feels like you’re in a rainforest and lots of places to eat or shop surrounding the massive waterfall/rainforest. If you fly to Changi, definitely go see jewel"
771,We checked in for our flight and then BEFORE going through immigration we travelled on the moving walkway (covered) to this amazing complex. Plenty of signs with directions. W bought more here than downtown.  Plenty of restaurants and a huge food hall.  Loved looking at the waterfall from all floors.  Returned to Terminal 3 and went through immigration to wait for our flight.  Hope to have longer time to see more on my next visit.
772,You have to come to believe how big this place is. The vortex is definitely a unique attraction that you should snap a selfie with. Lots of dining choices here as well.
773,"Whenever rain spoils our outing plan, we struggle to find a place to get together with a group of friends. When Tampines Hub was opened, I was amazed and that's where we plan if it rains. Now, with Changi Jewel, we have another place where we can spend a whole day without getting bored with family and kids. Kids play area, beautiful spots to take pics, shopping, lot of restaurants and food court, Imax. There's so much more. It's a mall close to nature. It may be crowded now since it's a new attraction in Singapore. Definitely worth visiting and spending time."
774,"Mall is aesthetically beautiful. Integration of hotel with retail and dining, coupled with gardens and facilities to offer travellers a different experience. If time permits, take the sky train from either Terminal 1, 2, or 3 for a stop over.  Plenty of parking lots. Clear signages. Unfortunately lines are very long at all diners."
775,"This is the shopping mall with the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. Besides all the major brands and restaurants, you can walk in an indoor garden without the heat. There is an early luggage check-in counter for people who decides to shop around before leaving the country. Because it is a new mall, it is relatively crowded and some areas need to be sorted out still."
776,"The new Changi Jewel is a must do for those passing through Singapore. A spectacular piece of architecture that is well thought through and perfectly executed. 

The gardens and waterfall are quite stunning and  the array of shops and restaurants but every other airport to shame. 

The Jewel has early checking facilities, luggage storage and all sorts of thing to occupy all ages.   The ideal place to pass time if you have long periods between flights, or need somewhere comfortable to hang out while waiting for your departure. 

MRT to the door, luggage storage and lots to see and do. Perfect."
777,"If u are coming or going to singapore dont forget to drop by at the jewel... right in the neart of the airport whenever your in departure or arrival you can find it easily. Can  roam around to see the view from top to bottom . And its free... 
And some added attractions where about to soon. cant wait to see them also."
778,"Jewel was just recently open. To get to Jewel is easy. Cheapest transport will be the MRT. It is situated near to Changing airport. The mall is huge and there are plenty of restaurants that serves different kind of cuisine.  There are plenty of shops to do your shopping. I believe this is where families spend their time as this place is crowded. You can see long queue at some of the well known restaurant. Here is the place that you can spend hours and hours here. They even have a food court and Shaw cinema. It is conveniently located next to the airport terminal. The waterfall landscape is breathtaking. If you do not know how to spend your weekend, Jewel is the place to hang out"
779,"This mall is amazing! You have to see the indoor waterfall. When you land in Terminal 1, at changi airport, just walk over to the waterfall. The plants are real! There is a ""splash zone"" but don't worry about it. It's only a little drizzle effect. Nothing big deal. After seeing the waterfall on the airport level, go down the escalator to the level below, and you can see the wall of water. Spectacular. Don't miss it!"
780,"I visited Jewel on her third day of public opening .  It is a one stop haven for gathering of families, and friends. There are many eateries  (albeit the Long queues) with wide price range : cafes , Food courts, restaurants, fast food outlets. It also can fulfil your shopping"
781,Don’t miss this. We had a 6 hr layover & decided to check out Jewel. It was worth the hassle of going through immigration again. The waterfall & plants are amazing. You forget you’re in an airport. The music & falling water is very calming & relaxing check it out on multiple
782,"For those catching a flight at Changi, do allocate at least 2 hours on top of your 3 hours airport procedure departure clearance. Jewel is something different from the ones in the city like Ion or Takashimaya. Jewel connects T1, T2, T3 with link bridges for patrons on a 5 mins"
783,"This is more than a mall, it is a destination by itself, once you approach the Waterfall, the feeling is like Welcome to the Jungle !  The greeneries, waterfall, trails are so soothing, a great respite from the city life.  Of cos, it is still a mall with plenty of food and"
784,"The Jewel sparkles for the BEST AIRPORT ON EARTH. Maybe forever. Go there to soothe your nerve if you are bored and tired. Abundance in quality F&B and I got what I wanted and was quite happy with this ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL mega-mall.  Avoid Fri, Sat , Sun and all Public Holidays."
785,"Jewel opened in mid April. Lots of publicity as well as pre opening tours organised. I missed my pre opening tour due to overseas travel. So I thought I’ll go on a weekday evening after the crowd thins out. The mall was still crowded and some queues seen at more popular F&B establishments. Had dinner at Violet Oon and it was as always yum yum. Impression of the mall is good and better in the evenings. No spoilers here, you got to be there to experience it. What was also impressive was at the exit of the car park, you can key in your car number and a display will show a pic of your car and the location as well as directions to get to your car. Nice."
786,"It a must go and the nite waterfall show is a 'must watch'. It's an inclusive design where wheelchair bound, old, young, teenaged & kids can enjoy. So we'll connected with the 3 terminals."
787,As an experience a visit to Jewel is a great experience. Great selection of restaurants and a cinema but the indoor water feature is awesome. Well worth a day out there. Weekdays was not too busy.
788,"Beautiful view of Changi Jewel from different terminals.
Restaurants around the Jewel are great but you can pay double or close to."
789,Singaporeans are great at creating something from nothing like gardens by the bay. This is another example of it. A very pleasant experience if you have a few hours to spend in the airport. Make time on your departure and go a bit early. lots of shopping and food options as well but its a good and pleasant experience.
790,"The place is filled of forest structures with one of a kind indoor waterfall that changes color, and made it look like more astonishing.
As you look closer using the level of stairs where you can take a live and closer look will set you to the wonderful sight of changi jewel.
The thing is that by this time some of the stalls are quiet not set yet and because of the opening, restaurants and cafe are full of people who wished to visit and witness the beauty of the jewel of Singapore.
So if you are planning to visit the jewel make sure you are ready to the idea that you at least grab something at home before going on the trip.
It was fun when the show runs every after 30 minutes."
791,"This latest iconic Singapore landmark  which recently opened in April 2019 is easily accessible via the various terminals in Changi Airport. 

Open 24 hours, the main highlight of all is the largest indoor waterfall. Loved the Shiseido Forest Valley which is like a park within a building. 

Lots of shopping and food to fill your tummies. 

If you are looking to catch a flight and still explore Jewel, it is advisable you give yourself ample time to move around so that you will not have to rush."
792,"Located in the heart of Changi airport and well connceted to all Terminal make this mall become ""A Must visit spot"" for whoever  transit or visiting Singapore.
Beside A Beautiful indoor ""Water Fall"" that attracting all visitors , they also have a very nice roof garden with various cafe shop n bars for coffee or cold beers.
Mall also full of choices of various resto n fastfoods plus huge shopping area. 
Fully recomended to visit 👍👍"
793,"This is a gigantic place - gigantic vortex in a gigantic mall. The waterfall/vortex is certainly impressive, a great attraction. It is surrounded by shops and restaurants, and thousands of trees and plants. One wonderful feature is the Early Check-in Counter. You can check in early and go around enjoying the sights and sounds, shopping and eating before you go to your terminal for departure. Highly recommended."
794,"Beautifully done. Looks fabulous with the lightning in the evening. The landscaping with the trees, artificial waterfall and the trains timed to cross each other right behind the water fall adds to the beauty of it."
795,"This place certainly is a jewel, not because of the shopping and dining experiences on offer, because they are the same as every other shopping mall in Singapore. It is the waterfall and the greenery that separates this place from the rest. You could spend an afternoon amongst"
796,"Just spent 3 visits taking in this game changing shopping And dining concept in the east . In 3 consecutive days, we made 3 visits over breakfast, late lunch and supper. Truly astounding experience save for the excessive crowding in the day time on the weekend. This has made us"
797,"Jewel just opened over the weekend, and it is attracting a lot of people to shop and dine. The attractions are not fully opened yet, but the crowds are piling up as there are many brands located in Jewel itself.  Probably one of the crowd pullers for now is the indoor rainfall"
798,"Go and do what you want to do- shop, eat, watch a show... or simply do nothing... and be wowed by everything. Excellent place!"
799,"This is truly a one of a kind terminal, with a spectacular indoor waterfall and gardens. There are shops and eating places aplenty, to meet every budget. And a movie theatre as well as an awesome light show too. Truly, this makes it all worthwhile to go to the airport earlier,"
800,"The Jewel is simply amazing. Located just within Changi Airport this could start your arrival or departure in a huge hype. 

The waterfall is definitely astonishing with various greenery in the background. Roaming around will make you feel that you  are in a different world.

The variety of shops and restaurants also add to the mix making the whole place in a new level.

We will definitely keep coming back when we get a chance."
801,"Now when one arrives, leave or stopover in Singapore, an hour or two should be set aside for a visit to the newest attraction, the Jewel.

This is what I did on my flight home from a business trip. I walked over from T2 and reached at 9 pm to admire the huge waterfall and ogle at the sights. I was amazed that it was actually 5 floors tall with another 5 levels below ground. A lot of shops to visit as some are appearing in Singapore for the first time.

As promised to my kids, I queued up in Shake Shack for the world famous burgers from America. Just managed to join the queue at the closing cut off time of 9.15 pm to grab some of their signature hamburgers for taking away.

Another feather on Changi airport's cap, being voted one of the best airports in the world. They have upped the game with the new attraction that cost a cool SGD 1.3 billion to build..."
802,"The Jewel is the gigantic shopping mall with varieties of shops and restaurants.  The famous one is the fountain that shall make you stop to see it.  At night time there are the light show at Fountain.

Recommend for visiting"
803,"This is right next to T1. I believe non traveller actually travel her specially to visit. It is a massive mall with shops, restaurants and a truly magnificent centrepiece. Not actually sure how to describe it. You just have to see from my picture. It is tropical with lots of greenery and a massive waterfall (funnel) in the middle. Entry is free. It is worth getting to the airport a bit earlier and have a wonder. Very impressive."
804,"It's quite nice (not particularly special, just a big mall) but a huge inconvenience for people who want to use the airport for its actual function. It makes the airport MRT station far too busy at peak times and more stressful than is necessary. It can't be accessed once you've passed passport control anyway so it isn't that useful for people who are flying. This really wasn't very well thought through."
805,"The waterfall is really awesome. The shopping mall is huge!! However, way too crowded. Every shops and restaurants are way too crowded. It's hard to walk. Even going to see the waterfall is a chore. So packed. Filled with people taking selfie. 
But the mall will be a great place to walk and hang out if there are lesser people. Alot of flagship stores are there."
806,What a truly remarkable concept. We spent 4-5 hours on the public holiday here. We were awe struck by the beauty of the fountain and surrounding gardens. As for the shops & restaurants there is something for every budget.
807,"I & my wife went to the Jewel after much publicity from local media.

Pros:
big & airy space. large fountain

Cons:
Fake & very artificial
Clone of shopping just like any mall
Nothing special extremely boring
too many people & overcrowded
too many plants & obstructions on the higher levels means you cannot see the water at most vantage points
similar to the fountain of wealth at Suntec just a bigger

this ""attractions"" are for singaporeans who have no life lol 
watching my toilet bowl water flush is more satisfying and uses less time & money lol"
808,"Modern architecture infused with nature, that’s what I felt when I first stepped into the jewel. Indeed it is a great creation and I believed, many thoughts and efforts have been put into designing this latest addition at the already world famous changi airport!

It’s a rather huge mall that’s connected to all three terminals at the changi international airport. You can find many famous eateries located within the mall itself. Walked towards the centre of the mall and you will see this great fountain, waterfall, whatever you call it. Amazing structure located in the middle of the building, with natural lights and greeneries all round. It’s amazing just to transit from the modern to the nature in just less than a five minutes walk!"
809,Largest indoor waterfall... near Changi Airport ... people who are travelling via singapore try to visit this ... with worlds best outlets
810,"What a wow moment to see the huge waterfall feature above ground levels and in the basement. Nothing much to be desired for the shopping area, just another typical mall that is all plain and white, to be honest, we didn't buy anything in the shops. We stayed for food and watched the waterfall."
811,"While it has the first pokemon centre out of japan, and some merchandise customised for Singapore.... else it is just a large shopping mall cum a Gardens by the bay feel

Its Nike store, one of the largest in Asia which allowed u to do customisation of shoes in lace and tag.....

Do note that u need to exit your terminal to get to jewel

To have a better view of the garden and to enjoy some of its facilities- it s good to do it daytime (from mid june 2019 onwds)
Do not just focus on the light show of the vortex fountain!"
812,"While ending our Singapore trip,we decided to reach the airport early,so that we could visit the famous Changi airport and have a look at the airport,it's attractions and the mall,which we had heard so much about.

And reaching the airport early didn't disappoint at all,as we saw the world's largest man made waterfall surrounded by tropical trees amongst other things. Jewel mall is a great place,for high end and high Street shopping,it offers so much variety,and from what I could understand,you can get the tax return on ur purchase,if u show ur boarding pass at the GST return counter (however please check before buying,as the rules keep changing) 
Even the duty free shops at Changi airport itself,have so much to offer,if I have to put it that ways,then surely it's a shopper's paradise,so if you are in a mood to shop,have enough time in hand and splurge happily while saving the taxes."
813,"Singapore has been known as a green city and the Jewel is a good show for the name. Incorporating natural elements and designs, walking into the Jewel can be compared to walking into a huge greenhouse, on top of being a grand 10 storey shopping mall. 

If you are stopping by Singapore or already in Singapore, a trip down to Jewel would definitely be worth your while. One can easily spend hours walking around and exploring the massive mall which is easily accessible by public transport (CG2 Changi Airport). 

You can access Jewel directly from Terminal 1, or cross the linkway from Terminal 2 and 3. Currently, if you are landing in Terminal 4, you have to take a free shuttle bus to Terminal 2 before crossing over.

Early check-in counters are at level one for those who wish to explore the Jewel before leaving; additionally, baggage and luggage can be stowed temporarily in Jewel (Level 1, right beside the check-in counters) at a fee (dependent on luggage sizes). 

The 300 retail shops from local and foreign brands are sure to keep you occupied for a few hours. Hence, I recommend not driving into Jewel as their parking fee is comparatively costly ($0.04 per minute for the first 90 minutes and $5.00 for each subsequent half an hour)."
814,"Had sone time to kill before taking a flight and spent it at the new Jewel shopping and dining mall at Changi airport 
Being a world class and modern city, this is now the new icon for Singapore 
Entry to the food plaza at the main entrance was being controlled from a long queue as if a super popular sight seeing spot!
It’s a must visit and suggest you reach the airport (terminal 1) at least with an hour with yourself to do justice to the new attraction 
Enjoy 😉"
815,"For the people staying the East, is another shopping place with lotsa eateries. 

For those who are traveling will be a place to drop by earlier for relaxation before departing. 

For families like myself, is a place for every ages. 

Love to hang around at the airports and Jewel, but hopefully the crowd will reduce slightly. Currently is too crowded due to recent opening."
816,"Wonderful waterfall with up and down stairs from all levels. Or go up and down the escalators on the outer circle and zoom along the starburst shop-lined links. The shops are great, a mixture of prices. Everything from a Michelin one star oriental restaurant to a Marks & Spencers for food. A very cheap shop for rings and things. Basement food court and dining will be added later at the top overlooking the waterfall. paid attractions will be added from mid-summer. A coffee shop contains a museum at the back."
817,"With more than 200 shops...an Imax Theatre..and more..all set inside a Jemstone shaped building. A worlds tallest manmade waterfall inside with thousands of plants in a verdent forest. 

Think... planet Pandora inside a shopping mall.

The waterfall creates a positive feel as the droplets of water fill the air in the forested central atrium. This is a mall unlike any.
Small gardens are scattered everywhere.

You could spend a whole.day there and never get bored. 

2 thumbs up. Stunning."
818,It's supposed to be an airport not a shopping centre for people who aren't even getting flights it makes traveling around the airport really annoying with everywhere super crowded and full of people
819,"Wouldn't mind going to the airport earlier with this new gem of Changi Airport !

Were at the preview before its official opening to the general public.

With a hotel, a cinema, a huge supermarket and all the restaurants and shops, and a in-door botanic garden with water-fall, a fusion of everything that you could imagine ;)

Just make sure you don't forget to board your flight !"
820,"Conveniently connected to Terminal 1, 2, and 3 of Changi Airport and has many shops, including a nice food court, the Jewel was such a World of Wonder with a beautiful stream in its heard and surrounded by the green forest. I was wowed  by its beauties!!!"
821,"Not only is Jewel a shopper's paradise, it has luscious greenery, the world's tallest indoor waterfall and a mind boggling variety of dining and watering outlets. No longer can transit passengers complain of boredom at Changi airport. If you are feeling jet lagged, go immerse yourself in nature. It's therapeutic! After you have recharged yourself, indulge in some retail therapy or go hunt for insta-worthy photo opportunities. Need to rest your tired feet? Go catch the latest blockbuster movies. This cinema boasts IMAX with Laser and DTS:X sound capable halls. There's also a hall specially for families with young children. If fatigue sets in, go catch forty winks at Yotelair. Sweet dreams..."
822,"We were staying overnight at the Crowne Plaza as a stop over from Europe and noticed this monstrous place had opened on the same day - Jewel shopping centre. We saw it that night and the next day before flying out.
Definitely put it in the list if passing through or staying in Singapore. The featured waterfall is like nothing else I have seen and cascades over 5 floors. Seeing it at night is better than during the day even though it is still magnificent during the day.
Shopping everywhere, level 4 just for kids shopping, top floor has attractions and adult eateries with a further 2 levels of eating all the way down below."
823,"Jewel provides a great shopping and dining experience for the locals and travellers. Didn't have the time to roam around much but seems like there are many shops. I like the indoor waterfall and nature within Jewel. Good relaxing place. 
Problem is the parking. Maybe because the Jewel just opened, so natural that many people to storming there to check out."
824,"Q about 2 hours for the food. 
Order 2 piece chicken, prefer KFC.
Nice curly fries. Waffles is nice, but ice cream topping is small. Root beer float is nice.
Q is too long for a consider fast food restaurant. Too few tables too. 
Management need to improve the Q time to accommodate to tourists who have short transit time in Singapore."
825,"With its breathtaking rain vortex set in a rainforest atmosphere, Jewel makes a good first and last impression for visitors to Singapore. For locals, the draw is new-to-Singapore brands like Shake Shack, Pokémon Center and Burger & Lobster, as well as returning brands like A&W. I also liked that I could earn both Changi Rewards points and CapitaStar$ at the same time.

An important point to note is that Jewel is not in the transit (restricted) area. It is located before departure immigration so it is open to everyone, not just those who are travelling.

Also, another important thing to note is that Jewel is first and foremost a shopping mall. So for travellers, I would suggest that you leave your heavy luggage in the mall’s left luggage facility, or come by on your departure day and do an early check-in and bag drop at the mall itself. Check if your airline has this feature. 

Please consider being considerate to everyone as we don’t want people falling over or getting blocked by a mountain of heavy luggage ;)

This is because it will be very crowded, even after the initial hype will have died down, as there will be many local residents patronising Jewel as well. Changi Airport is different from airports in many cities because 1) Singapore is small so the airport is just a 20-min drive away to the city center & 2) it is highly accessible by regular public transport.

There are many casual eateries, including a food court, as well as a cinema and supermarket in Jewel (all at regular city prices and not the typical inflated airport price), so this essentially means it also serves as a neighbourhood mall for locals living in the East and North-East regions of Singapore, as well as a lunch-time/after work spot for those working in the airport area or Changi Business Park."
826,"If you're ever in Changi Airport, you gotta to visit Jewel located next to Terminal 1-- it's certainly a game changer when it comes to airports and terminals around the world. 

Opened only on April 17, 2019 to the public, it bills itself as a ""multi-dimensional lifestyle destination that seamlessly integrates one-of-a-kind play attractions and extensive landscaping with unique shopping and dining concepts, accommodation and aviation facilities"". In other words, prepared for a jaw-dropping time!

When you step in, you'll be impressed by a huge 40m high waterfall, that forms the very nucleus of the complex. Called the HSBC Rain Vortex, it's the world's tallest indoor waterfall. The casade sets the tone of the whole place -- mesmerizing and simply stunning.

There's plenty of eat with local fare and international offerings littered all over the huge complex. Even if you're not hungry, you will be once you saunter pass these food outlets (seems there's more than 100 eateries and gastronomic icons housed there). Of course, you can get your retail fix readily any time of the day (you don't have to head off town with this mega mall in sight).

From the Forest Valley to the Canopy Park, the lush greenery in the complex makes it a climate-controlled indoor garden perfect for the weary traveler looking for a short respite. (Hint: Have a beer at the Canopy Park -- you won't regret it!)

Wear comfortable shoes if you're gonna wander around and expect to spend plenty of time here! Connected via a light rail network (free) with the various terminals in Changi Airport, it would be a huge travesty if you didn't stop by this new icon of Singapore."
827,So we decided to brave the crowds and visit Singapore Changi Jewel our latest mall cum garden cum terminal. Quite amazing. World’s tallest waterfall.  If you’re ever at Changi airport don’t miss it. #maneklady #manektravel
828,"Great place, with great food too. Loved every spots of the place. A good place for people who wanted to relax their body & mind."
829,"Jewel makes Singapore Changi Airport truly the most interesting airport in the world.  So much entertainment here for everyone 👍🏻

If you have just arrived, you can store your luggage for 24 hours maximum. Storage charges depends on the size of your luggage.
If departing Singapore, you can take advantage of the early checkin if your flight is on one of the 25 participating airlines. (See photo for list of airlines)"
830,"Jewel... Yes its rightly named. Indeed its a jewel in already a very interesting airport of the world. and We are proud of it and all the people behind who contributed to shape it.

A place well balanced for all age groups and varied interest...  Though few attractions yet to open by mid June. But most of it is open and a very immersive place.

Not just only for tourists, but a must visit for Locals too... as one can see best of the Singapore things ... all in one place, well weaved together.
- A Biggest indoor waterfall... gives a feel of Suntec water fountain & MBS Digital playground.
- A garden area all around the waterfall - Gives a feel of Gardens by the bay and Garden city.
- Shopping mall & F&B outlets - shows Singapore love for shopping and food...

Don't miss out night time lighting and Light n sound show, as it enhances the experience further.... 

Whatever time in hand... its worth spending it here and get glimpse of Singapore.
If just transiting, then also can have a glimpse of it by travelling by skytrain...

Enjoy Singapore Jewel."
831,"I was fortunate to score tixs to the preview of Jewel and I was impressed. From the manmade waterfall (not forgetting the light show), to the variety of plants to the numerous eateries. Jewel is a destination in its own right. You will be spoilt for choice when it comes to dining options. Will definately spend some time there before my next flight out.."
832,"Jewel is officially open on 17 April 2019, shops there generally have a 24hour opening hours whilst some close at 10~11pm.

However, as a Singaporean, a word of advice, since Jewel just recently open, majority of Singaporeans will visit the place therefore, it will be ridiculously crowded. We went to the place during the preview opening and lines for fast food was about 2hours long. 

Lightshow starts at 7.30pm, lasts 5mins and repeats itself every 30mins (7.30pm,8pm,8.30pm,9pm 9.30pm) The best view is actually at Level 4 base on my opinion.

In order to get the best of both world, both viewing Jewel during the day and at night to coincide with the Light show, best time to visit would be around 4pm so you get time to walk around and have your dinner before checking out the Lightshow at 7.30pm.

Sunsets generally around 6pm~6.30pm in Singapore so you can plan your time around it.

Theres also baggage drop off point which takes care of your bags for a small fee. Subsequently if you are leaving Singapore, you can opt in for an early check-in, within Jewel itself which allow you to check-in your luggage approx 24hours before your flight if im not wrong.

Otherwise you can stay in YotelAir located within Jewel at Level 4, which allows you to stay/rent a room for 4hours at about 60~70dollars including an ensuite

Jewel is actually located right outside Terminal 1 Arrival Hall, it's outside immigration. It is also connected to T2 and T3 via a Skybridge at the level above the Departure Hall."
833,"This is a great place for tourist to take in and get to know about Singapore. Jewel @ Changi Airport has showcased what this little red dot is jam-packed from walking trails (nature reserved to man-made gardens) at Level 5, shopping - local & international brands, dining (local delicacies to international) to a movie theatre (basement). The wonder and highlight of Jewel attractions can be found within its website, The most important thing to note is what awaits you beyond Jewel. In my personal opinion, there are attractions of similar features beyond Jewel but in greater scale such as the flower dome at Garden by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands laser light shows, etc. Jewel is easily accessible from all terminals except Terminal 4 where you will need to take a free shuttle."
834,The indoor waterfall and gardens are amazing as is the shopping. Only just opened so not all stores are open however you can occupy yourself whilst waiting for a flight or just come for a day visit. Its well worth it
835,Was fortunate to be one of the early visitors to the Jewel which is situated around T1 @ Changi. The vortex and rain forest created is most enchanting. Only Singapore can be imaginative like this and use space most intelligently. Despite the crowd on a public holiday - Good Friday - the place was orderly.
836,"Once you're in JEWEL, you would'nt want to leave till we decided to stay overnight @yotelair. 10 levels of shopping and dining experience or simply enjoy watching the mesmerising and majestic rain vortex and exploring therapeutic nature walks.
Easily accessed from any terminal and by MRT.
Excited to visit JEWEL again :)"
837,"When you live on such a small island, claustrophobic with concrete, you need to escape to Nature but with civilisation close by, and that's what you get with Jewel, so emblematic of our nation with its garden within a city, food galore and endless shops to feed your consumerist obsession. The hanging gardens remind you of Gardens by the Bay and the flowers of the Botanical Gardens but the cascading Waterfall and swirling vortex quite unique. Wonderful to watch the swirling water sucked into the Bermuda Triangle and recycled back, all from rainwater so very environmentally friendly.
Nearly all the food chains in Singapore are represented here, from Din Tai Fung to Toast ox, good that far-flung shops like Pow Sing are brought here, you don't have to go to town for Ma Maison or Hoshino's too. Didn't bother to queue for A n W's nostalgic root beer, 2 and a half hours but diehards did queue. We had the chicken rice set meal at Pow Sing's, delicious with lots of chicken meat, fried cauliflower and steamed broccoli but pricey at $15 per set compared to your $2.50 hawker centre or $7 food court fare. However queue only 20 minutes, so not complaining. 
Even the prices in the crowded food court here were higher than their counterparts elsewhere in Singapore. 
Retail includes my favorite Muji and the other usual suspects are Watson and other familiar brands though the Pokeman or is it thd Pikachu shop is a novelty. 
Fairprice Finest in the basement offered designer brand potato chips at a discount but fresh vegetables seemed less than at other outlets."
838,"We visited the Jewel during the preview.

It is a great way for visitors to Singapore to end their trips. They can check in for their flights early at the Jewel before indulging in the delights of the Jewel.

There are shopping, restaurants, garden and, of course, the world's tallest indoor waterfall at 40 metres."
839,"its an amazing and spectacular man made waterfall. with lots of shops and cafes you will never want to leave jewel. If not for shopping perhaps you want to just walk around and see the beautiful green garden, its just breathtaking..  jewel is a must go place should your next destination not another an hour or more."
840,"A great place for transit passengers to shop,dine and spend time. 40metres High Rain Vortex (indoor waterfall)  With hourly night lights show from 830pm to 1230am) Four storey High Forest Valley trail. Tech,smart designed cabins at Yotelair for few hours or overnight rest. "
841,"You could easily spend a couple of hours here, with the wide variety of shops, eateries and entertainment. The rain vortex is no doubt the centrepiece in this 7 storey complex. The gushing waterfall can be heard almost everywhere in the mall. Pokemon centre is a pitstop for"
842,"After all the promotion and promise to make Singapore Airport the best of the world, Jewel seems to come out short delivering all that had promised. After walking around the building during preview, it is just a big shopping mall. Its true that Jewel does have a few more"
843,"To call this place an architectural marvel is an understatement. You have to be there to immerse yourself in the atmosphere as no amount of words and media contents will be able to justify the experience. Surrounded by lush greeneries with futuristic architectures, this place is"
844,"There have been signs around the airport warning you that if you dont have more than 5 hours of connection time, you are not advised to visit the Jewel. I can certainly see some truths in this. To visit this stunning addition to Singapore Changi Airport, you need time...u need"
845,Newly opened jewel of Singapore Changi Airport. A 10 storey high shopping mall with lots of branded stuff and great eating places. Also an iconic musical light waterfall.
846,"The Crown Jewel to Changi Airport, awesome and yet invoking a sense of tranquility, even if it was meant to be a lifestyle shopping mall. The 40m tall Rain Vortex is the highlight and the Canopy Walk on the topmost floor makes it's grandeur apparent from all vantage points."
847,"Opportunity to witness the tallest indoor waterfall in the world ...the choices of F & B outlets were good, ambience was excellent ,crowd flow was well coordinated & controlled. Me & my Wife had a wonderful afternoon there . Thank you Singapore Changi Airport . "
848,"The next trending and most visited place in Singapore. Come and enjoy the atmosphere, waterfall show. You will like it. "
849,Singapore has done it again. Pushing Changi airport to the next level. Amazing place with a garden and food. Highly recommended for all travellers 
850,"went for the preview..fantastic variety of shops.. lots of choice for f&b. well catered for travelers.. early check in, bag storage etc to allow u to get on with the shopping n eating..not fully open tho.. the gardens on the 5th floor n play areas are due to open in June 2019. those driving there, note that the b2 n b2m levels have more expensive parking rates.. better to park in b3 to b5 levels"
851,"Best Airport with the best JEWEL. Preview Day, too many people. 17 April - The day it will open up to the the WORLD! Best iconic place for all proud Singaporeans. The world will come and celebrate this magnificent place. Catch the day & night Rain Vortex. 100 shopping and dinning deals to choose from. Eat, Shop & Travel!  For kids, the 1st ever Pokemon Centre outside Japan."
852,"I was looking for an airport called Jewel Changi Airport all i found was a mall called Jewel Changi, which is connected to all Changi Airport terminals , so, this tells me Jewel Changi is a mall in itself not a Jewel Changi airport so that was confusing when people talk of Jewel Changi as an Airport and not a mall 

Anyway........

What I like about it:

-Its easy to get to by MRT
-It's connected to all Terminals so I could leave the hotel a bit earlier just to shop and dine here.
-I was told by a sales staff at 12 cupcakes,  Basement 2 eateries opens 24 hours so that's good information
-An excellent selections of eateries 
-a lot of shops, e.g, big Pokemon store,  and there is even a supermarket, cinema. 
-Lots of stuff for kids to do on level 5; Maze garden, Mirror garden, slides, bouncy nets etc it spells fun.
-Jewel Changi mall is baby friendly with facilities for parents to make a bottle with hot and/ or room temperature water.  

NOTE: Slides, Bouncy Nets, Mirror Garden are not opened just yet but it should be ready in mid 2019

If you are planning to shop and dine often at Changi it makes sense to join it's Changi Rewards program."
853,"We visited Jewel during its preview period on 13 April 2019. The visitor will find many Instagram-worthy photo spots including the 40-m indoor waterfall called the HSBC Rain Vortex, the 4-storey Shiseido Forest Valley, and the Canopy Park located at the topmost level of the building. Many attractions in the Canopy Park will be opened only in June 2019, including Bouncing and Walking Nets, Hedge and Mirror Mazes, Discovery Slides and the Canopy Bridge. Another attraction worth waiting for is the Changi Experience Studio, a virtual world filled with amazing projection experiences, interactive games and immersive shows."
854,"The Rain Vortex and Canopy Park are simply beautiful and lovely nice place to chill out and relax. For last minutes shopping or if you've a busy schedule, here is the place to go to, quite a lot of local gift shops where you can gift from The Cookies Museum, Bengawan Solo,  IRVINS etc even from FairPrice Finess.  Check it out. 

If you are a vegan or vegetarian you can enjoy a lovely veg*n meal or the latest food trend - Impossible Meat Burger. Savour it at Prive at the Canopy with a nice lovely view. Or hop by to the famous Shake Shack for a veggie Burger. An Indian Vegetarian stall at the Food Court - Five Spice, if you like to have Indian Cuisine. Or to Cedele for healthy meal. 

A lot to do here - shopping, watching movies, people watching ..."
855,"Finally visited the mall. Never knew it has shops for all pockets. Bought shoes for the hubby from a German shop. Pizza Express there deserves 7 star rating because it is plastic free! I just had the best pizza of my life tonight! A pleasant shock to see no plastic straws, no plastic cutlery in this restaurant!! Hope all the restaurants here follow suit and make the place really green."
856,"This is where Singaporeans are truly blessed and proud of! A new place worth exploring..Parking can be expensive, but it's worth visiting with a good treat at L4, Samsui jewel by Soup Spoon Group and waterfall night view.  Romantic night for couples,  family and friends!"
857,"Just when you thought Changi Airport couldn't get any more traveller-friendly, they go and open the Prettiest Mall on Earth. Yes; it's more than a mall and you'll spend more time wondering how you ended up back at Gardens by the Bay than shopping, but it's still a mall. Not to say it isn't worth a visit, though. I walked from Terminal 1, which took about ten minutes. I was there at 8 in the morning the day after it had opened. The Rain Vortex isn't 24 hours so it wasn't running, which was fine, as the plants and other water features were stunning enough. The background music was blasting a bit too loudly, but maybe you don't hear it when a ten storey waterfall is thundering and the place is full of selfie-takers?

Move your legs and check it out, then be ready to hate your home airport even more."
858,"No doubt - Singapore Airport is one of the best, but now there is a new attraction:  The Jewel. More than 300 retail and dining facilities suited in a wonderful garden park. Indoor waterfall at 40m tall and enough space to take a quiet rest."
859,"It's a mall right next to the airport. Super convenient, B2 has lots of eateries. The Vortex is a great feature, unique. There is a supermarket at B2 too selling lots of Singapore products. Pow Sing Restaurant serves good Hainanese Chicken rice."
860,"An excellent place for one to dine, shop & indulge in, be it before catching a flight, during a flight transit or just there with families & friends to rest & relax & chill out. Witness the world’s tallest 40m high indoor waterfall at different points there! "

875,Jewel is a beautiful mall right beside changi Airport. Lots to offer tourists and locals alike. 24hra dining options for the red eye flights and the 40m tall rain votex is a must see.
876,Luckily we have internet savvy family members who managed to get preview tickets for 4 generations of family members to visit. The oldest is in her 90s and the youngest is 14. Total there were 8 of us. I’m glad that priority was given to wheelchair bound elderly and family. It was a great way to bond with the family even though the place was very crowded. There are many escalators near the lifts yet many able bodied visitors are fighting for space to use the lifts. Finally we reached the atrium! The Jewel was Fantastic! Awesome! Mesmerising! We watched the shows from a few different levels!
877,"Gotten their invitation during their preview/ soft opening during 11-17 April 2019.

Visited with family and kids on their first weekend.

Prior to entering to our preview time 7-10pm, it seem water leaking on the entrance at L1, cleaner can be seen placing the “container” on floor and cleaning the floor 😳...

The entire building are pretty big, to us is pretty much a combination of MBS, ION and Garden by the Bay. The 5th Level canopy bridge only open in June 10th for everyone. While only partial are open to public (never queue during the preview..) 

Pokémon Outlet at L4-201/202 - maybe is soft opening hence hourly time slot entrance ticket had been given ALL away BY MORNING as per their staff mentioned!! We was still wondering, preview given 4 time slot strictly for just the 3 hour stayed which mean people had been staying in the #Jewel since morning because the last entrance time slot was 9-10pm and they had been given the ticket in the morning... 🥺🙄

A&W located at B2-209 and required a queue of 1 hours... 😂 Never try during this visit but will do it next round. 

The waterfall light show operate half hourly (last show at 930pm) not sure will this apply after it grand opening on 17 April 2019 

Will be sharing some of their info in photo. Hope it help for other..."

The centrepiece attraction is of course, the HSBC Rain Vortex, the world's tallest indoor waterfall. Jewel is connected to terminals 1,2 & 3 with link bridges. Officially opening on 17April 2019. It's indeed spectacular!"
879,"I was actually visiting Jewel @ Changi with my elderly mum today,it’s a preview day.
It’s 7pm,timing was perfect & it was after our dinner(sadly we didn’t get to try any of the new restaurants or the returned of A&W due to our entrance timing,we’ll be starving if we waited).Anyway there’s lots to catch up with & eye opener,especially the very 1st time you’re there(my mum n I was).
This is amazing,awesome & beautifully architecture designs.You’ve got to really see this place in person to believe me,definitely no regrets.
Espcially for photographers wannabes,families & friends bondings/gatherings this is the new hunt!
It’s like Gardens by the bay + Marina bay sands + Airport in 1 building.It’s definitely way cooler to witness it yourselves & it’s family friendly with some play areas on the top floor(5th floor).
(*There’s signs that stated the play areas are ready on 10th June 2019.)
Seniors don’t have to worried about no resting areas as there’s plenty of wooden seats with aircon around.
It’s quite a nice stroll on the top floor(5th floor) as well.

As i’ve mentioned my mum & I we were there @ the perfect timing,we have seen the water falls & sky lights in 2 contrasts.Beautiful..(pictures that i’ve shared,below)
Aside from the water fall which was the main attraction,there’s famous restaurants & shops too.Not to forget to mention there’s also a cinema which I didn’t managed to spot.
See if you’re lucky to spot it & perhaps try catch a movie there,it’s family friendly designed as the media has mentioned.
Another reason why singaporeans loves to hang out in the airports even thou we’re aren’t travelling.😉✌🏼
Hope you enjoy reading my reviews & do take lots of pics while you’re there,no regrets!🤗"
